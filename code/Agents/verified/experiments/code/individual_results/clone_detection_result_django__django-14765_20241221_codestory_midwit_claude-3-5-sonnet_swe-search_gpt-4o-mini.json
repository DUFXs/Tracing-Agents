The first sample sets `self.real_apps` based on whether `real_apps` is provided and uses an assertion to ensure it is a set. The second sample has a different approach for handling the `real_apps` initialization and modifies the handling of `None`. They have different structures and logic, making them functionally dissimilar.\"}"

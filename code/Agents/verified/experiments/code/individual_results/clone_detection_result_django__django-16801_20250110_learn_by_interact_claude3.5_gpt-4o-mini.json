    "response": "{\"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar with added or modified statements. While the initial parts of both samples are similar, Code sample 2 has additional comments and statements that are not present in Code sample 1, specifically the explanation about the 'force' parameter and the logic handling deferred fields. This makes them syntactically similar yet functionally different in content.\"}"

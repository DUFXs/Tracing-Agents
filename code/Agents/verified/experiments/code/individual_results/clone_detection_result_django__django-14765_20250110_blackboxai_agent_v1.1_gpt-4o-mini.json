For instance, in sample 1, 'if real_apps is not None:' is changed to 'if real_apps is None:' in sample 2, and there is an additional comment in sample 2 that is not present in sample 1. Also, the assertion message is modified in sample 2 compared to sample 1. This indicates changes in the logic and structure of the code while retaining some common functionality.\"}"

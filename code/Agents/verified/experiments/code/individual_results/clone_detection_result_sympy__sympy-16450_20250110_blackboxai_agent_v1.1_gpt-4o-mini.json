In sample 1, there is a part that gathers existing assumptions with checks for variables like 'finite', but sample 2 combines this logic into a dictionary comprehension for creating the 'reps' mapping. This change indicates that while they achieve similar ends in variable substitutions, their syntactic structure has been adjusted, making them different but related.\"}"

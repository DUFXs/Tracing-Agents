Code sample 1 includes additional context and earlier code such as the comment about 'Work out renamed fields' and other preceding statements that are not present in code sample 2. Both samples include similar loops for processing app_label, model_name, and field_name, but the removal of context leads to a type-3 classification.\"}"

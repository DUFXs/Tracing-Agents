The code in code sample 2 performs similar ordering checks but handles the GROUP BY condition differently: instead of having a separate condition for group_by, it incorporates the group_by check into the default_ordering condition as a negative condition.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they perform the same fundamental logic (checking query ordering conditions) but with modified statements. The main difference is in how they handle the GROUP BY condition: Sample 1 uses a separate explicit check 'if self.query.group_by is not None: return False', while Sample 2 incorporates this check as 'not self.query.group_by' within the default_ordering condition. The logic is semantically similar but structured differently, with statements modified and reorganized, which is characteristic of a type-3 clone. Both implementations achieve the same goal but with slightly different syntactic structures.\"\n}"

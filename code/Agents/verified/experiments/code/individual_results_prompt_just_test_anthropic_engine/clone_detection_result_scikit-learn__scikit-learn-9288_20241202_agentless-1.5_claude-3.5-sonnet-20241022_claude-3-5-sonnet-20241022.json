The shared portion includes identical code for generating seeds, running k-means single iterations, and updating best results based on inertia. The main differences are: 1) Sample 2 has additional algorithm validation code at the start, 2) Sample 2 includes an 'else' branch for parallel execution, and 3) Sample 2 has an additional assignment to 'best_n_iter'. These modifications make it a type-3 clone where statements have been added but the core functionality remains similar.\"\n}"

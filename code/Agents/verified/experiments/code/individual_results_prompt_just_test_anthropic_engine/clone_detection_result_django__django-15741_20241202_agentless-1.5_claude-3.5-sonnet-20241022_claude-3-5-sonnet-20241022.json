It includes logic for handling ISO input formats. The code in code sample 2 is handling format caching by creating a cache key from format type and language, and attempting to retrieve a cached format value.\",\n    \"is_clone\": false,\n    \"classification\": \"N/A\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes and have different logic flows. While both deal with format handling in Django, sample 1 is focused on format value lookup through modules and settings, while sample 2 is focused on format caching. They have different control structures, different variables, and fundamentally different functionality. Sample 1 has a series of checks and fallbacks for finding format values, while sample 2 is implementing a caching mechanism. The only commonality is that they both handle format types and use the use_l10n variable, but their purposes and implementations are distinct.\"\n}"

    "response": "{\n\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 handles middleware adaptation in Django's request/response cycle. It stores the current handler state, attempts to adapt the handler based on whether the middleware is async or not, and updates the handler if middleware creation is successful. The code in code sample 2 performs a similar middleware adaptation process but has slightly different variable handling and additional error handling logic.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share the same core functionality of adapting middleware handlers in Django, but have some structural differences:\n1. Sample 1 explicitly stores current handler state in temporary variables (current_handler, current_handler_is_async) before adaptation, while Sample 2 uses the original variables directly\n2. Sample 2 includes additional error handling logic (else clause and ImproperlyConfigured check) that's not present in Sample 1\n3. The core adaptation logic (adapt_method_mode call and middleware creation) is nearly identical between both samples\n4. Both samples handle MiddlewareNotUsed exceptions in a similar way\nThe modifications are minor and the fundamental purpose and structure remains the same, making this a type-3 clone.\"\n}"

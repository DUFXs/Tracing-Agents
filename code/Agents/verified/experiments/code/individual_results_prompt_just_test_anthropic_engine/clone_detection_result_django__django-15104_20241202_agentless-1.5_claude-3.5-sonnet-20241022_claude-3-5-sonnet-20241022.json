The code iterates over sorted field items, performs deep deconstruction of each field, checks for remote field relationships, removes 'to' key from deconstruction if certain conditions are met, appends the deconstruction to fields_def, and finally returns fields_def.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-1\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are exactly identical in terms of code content, structure, and functionality. The only difference appears to be in the Git patch format showing 'index 7df5f70..6db1dcc 100644' in the first sample, which is metadata and not part of the actual code. The code logic, whitespace, variable names, and all other aspects are completely identical between the two samples.\"\n}"

The code in code sample 2 does something similar but handles both lists and tuples, setting appropriate delimiters ([]) for lists and (,) for tuples, and joins the elements with commas in a more concise way.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they perform the same basic functionality (converting iterables to string representations with appropriate delimiters) but with some structural differences. Both use similar logic for handling iterables and joining elements with commas, but sample 2 is more concise and handles an additional case (lists). The core functionality is the same, but sample 2 modifies the implementation by:\n1. Combining the element joining and delimiter addition into a single line\n2. Adding support for lists with different delimiters\n3. Handling the single-element tuple case implicitly through the right delimiter\nThese modifications make it a type-3 clone, where the basic structure and functionality are similar but with added and modified statements.\"\n}"

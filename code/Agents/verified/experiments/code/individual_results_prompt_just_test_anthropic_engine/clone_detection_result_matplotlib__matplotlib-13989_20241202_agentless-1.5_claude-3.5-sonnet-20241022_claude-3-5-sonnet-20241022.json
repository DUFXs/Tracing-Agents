    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"Both code samples are doing exactly the same thing: They handle density parameters for histogram plotting in matplotlib. Both samples first set a density value based on boolean operations of density and normed parameters, then check if density is true and stacked is false to set the density in hist_kwargs dictionary. Finally, both initialize an empty list called 'tops' to store histogram coordinates.\", \n\"is_clone\": true, \n\"classification\": \"type-1\", \n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are exactly identical in terms of code content. The only difference appears to be in the patch header line 'index 6b68737..d420a5c 100644\\\\n' which is present in sample 1 but not in sample 2. This difference is merely in the metadata/layout and not in the actual code content. The code logic, variables, operations, and even comments are exactly the same in both samples.\"}"

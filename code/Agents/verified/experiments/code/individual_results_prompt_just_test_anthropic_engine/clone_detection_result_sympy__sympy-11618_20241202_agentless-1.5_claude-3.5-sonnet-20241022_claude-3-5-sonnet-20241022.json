Both ultimately use the sqrt(sum((a-b)\u00b2)) formula, but the implementation details differ. Sample 1 uses a more concise approach with zero-padding, while Sample 2 uses explicit list creation and copying. The core functionality is the same, but statements have been modified and restructured, which is characteristic of type-3 clones.\"\n}"

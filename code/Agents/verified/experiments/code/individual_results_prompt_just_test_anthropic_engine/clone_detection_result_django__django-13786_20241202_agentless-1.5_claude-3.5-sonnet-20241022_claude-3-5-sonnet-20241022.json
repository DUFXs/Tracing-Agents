The code in code sample 2 shows a more complex operation that handles model alterations, specifically dealing with AlterModelOptions. It merges the existing options with new options, removes certain keys if they're not in the operation options, and then creates a new model with the updated options while keeping other parameters (name, fields, bases, managers) the same.\", \n\"is_clone\": true, \n\"classification\": \"type-3\", \n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they both contain the same CreateModel operation with identical parameters, but code sample 2 has additional statements for handling option modifications. The core functionality (CreateModel) is the same, but sample 2 has added statements for option processing before calling CreateModel. The added statements modify the 'options' parameter, but the basic structure remains similar. This fits the definition of a type-3 clone where statements are added but the core syntax remains similar.\"\n}"

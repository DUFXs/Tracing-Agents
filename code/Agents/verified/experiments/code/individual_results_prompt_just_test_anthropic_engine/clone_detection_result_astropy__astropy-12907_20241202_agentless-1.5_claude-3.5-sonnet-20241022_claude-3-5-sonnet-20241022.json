The code first checks if a condition is met to either create a coordinate matrix using _coord_matrix or create a zero matrix with numpy. Then it assigns values to the right portion of the matrix and finally concatenates left and right matrices horizontally using np.hstack.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-1\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are exactly identical, containing the same code with the same whitespace and layout. Both samples show the same operations: conditional creation of cright matrix, assignment of values, and horizontal stacking with cleft. There are no differences in identifiers, syntax, or functionality between the two samples.\"\n}"

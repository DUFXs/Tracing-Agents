If the view is async, it creates an async function to return the response.

The main difference is that sample 2 introduces a temporary variable 'response' to store the HttpResponseNotAllowed result before returning it, and adds an explicit 'else' clause, while sample 1 returns the HttpResponseNotAllowed directly. The core functionality (returning an HttpResponseNotAllowed with allowed methods, handling both async and sync cases) remains the same, but the implementation has slight structural modifications, which is characteristic of type-3 clones.\"\n}"

It also includes a clear() method that deletes all entries from a table. The code in code sample 2 performs the same database operation with slightly different variable names (result vs last_cache_key) and slightly different SQL string formatting, but is functionally the same operation. Both execute a query, fetch a result, and conditionally perform a DELETE operation based on that result.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-2\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are identical in structure and functionality, with only minor differences in identifier names (result vs last_cache_key) and string formatting styles ('DELETE FROM %s WHERE cache_key < %%s' vs 'DELETE FROM %s ' 'WHERE cache_key < %%s'). The logic flow and operations are exactly the same, just with different variable names and slightly different string formatting approaches. Additionally, sample 2 is missing some of the clear() method implementation, but the overlapping parts are type-2 clones.\"\n}"

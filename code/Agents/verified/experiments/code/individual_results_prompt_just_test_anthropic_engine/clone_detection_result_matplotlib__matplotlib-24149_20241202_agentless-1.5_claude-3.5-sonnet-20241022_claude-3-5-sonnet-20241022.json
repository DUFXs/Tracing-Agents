The core functionality is the same, but sample 2 has modified and additional statements. Both use StopIteration exception handling and have the same fallback behavior, but they're wrapped in slightly different contexts and with different variable names. The structural similarity is clear, but they're not identical enough to be type-1 or type-2 clones.\"\n}"

It handles three cases: empty tuples ('()'), single-element tuples (with a trailing comma), and multi-element tuples. It uses a list comprehension to join elements with commas. The code in code sample 2 also converts an AST Tuple node to a string, but uses a more explicit if-elif-else structure to handle the three cases, with the single-element case using string formatting.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-3\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they perform the same function (converting AST Tuple nodes to string representation) but use slightly different syntactic structures to achieve it. Both handle the same three cases (empty tuple, single element, multiple elements) but differ in their implementation approach. Sample 1 uses a more consolidated approach with a list comprehension and conditional comma addition, while Sample 2 uses explicit conditional branches. The core functionality remains the same, but statements have been modified and restructured. This matches the definition of a type-3 clone where the code is syntactically similar but has modified statements while maintaining the same functionality.\"\n}"

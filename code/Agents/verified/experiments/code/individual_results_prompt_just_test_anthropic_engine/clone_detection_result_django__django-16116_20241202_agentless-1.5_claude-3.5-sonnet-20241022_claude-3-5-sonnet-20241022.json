It includes conditional logic for checking changes, exiting with status code 1, and writing migration files either to the last migration files or creating new ones. It also includes the start of a write_to_last_migration_files method. The code in code sample 2 shows a larger portion of the same file that includes both the argument parser configuration for '--check' and '--scriptable' options, followed by the exact same migration file writing logic and method definition.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because code sample 2 contains all of code sample 1's content plus additional code for argument parsing. The core functionality (the migration file writing logic) is identical in both samples, but code sample 2 has added statements at the beginning for configuring command-line arguments. This fits the definition of a type-3 clone where the code is syntactically similar but has added statements.\"\n}"

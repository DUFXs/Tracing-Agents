Return the modified field\n\nHowever, they differ in their implementation approach:\n- Sample 1 does it directly in a _resolve_output_field method\n- Sample 2 does it in an as_sqlite method with additional window expression handling\nThe core logic is similar but with modified and additional statements, making this a type-3 clone.\"\n}"

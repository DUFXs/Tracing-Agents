    "response": "{\n    \"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is a pytest hook implementation for test report generation that handles xfail marks and unexpected success cases. It yields an outcome and processes the test result, particularly focusing on the 'call' phase of test execution. The code in code sample 2 is a more comprehensive implementation that includes multiple pytest hooks (pytest_runtest_setup and pytest_runtest_makereport) and handles both skip and xfail marks, with additional logic for handling running or not running xfailed tests.\",\n    \"is_clone\": false,\n    \"classification\": \"N/A\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because while they share some similar functionality around handling xfail marks, they are fundamentally different in their scope and purpose. Sample 1 is specifically focused on report generation with simple xfail mark handling, while Sample 2 contains multiple hook implementations including test setup and report generation, with more complex logic for handling both skip and xfail marks. The code structure, control flow, and functionality are significantly different. While they may share some common elements (like handling xfail marks), the overall implementation and purpose are distinct enough that they cannot be considered clones of any type.\"\n}"

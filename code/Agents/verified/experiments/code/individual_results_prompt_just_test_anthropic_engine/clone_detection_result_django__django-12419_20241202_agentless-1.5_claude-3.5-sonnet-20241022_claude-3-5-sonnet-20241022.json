They set identical security-related configuration variables: SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD, SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS, SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT, SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY, SECURE_SSL_HOST, and SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT with the same values.

In Python, single and double quotes are functionally equivalent for string literals. The code structure, variable names, values, and overall functionality remain exactly the same. This falls under type-1 classification as it's only a superficial difference in syntax that doesn't affect the code's behavior or meaning.\"\n}"

It compares fields based on creation_counter and model attributes, with basic checks for attribute existence. The code in code sample 2 also implements the same methods but with more sophisticated comparison logic, particularly in the __lt__ method where it includes additional ordering rules based on model metadata (app_label and model_name) and handles edge cases more thoroughly.\", \n\"is_clone\": true, \n\"classification\": \"type-3\", \n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share the same basic structure and purpose (implementing comparison and hash methods for Field objects), but code sample 2 contains modified and additional statements that make the comparison logic more robust. Key differences include:\n1. The __eq__ method in sample 2 uses getattr() with default values instead of explicit hasattr() checks\n2. The __lt__ method in sample 2 has additional logic for handling model comparisons using app_label and model_name\n3. The __hash__ method in sample 2 includes more model-related attributes in the hash tuple\nThese modifications maintain the same basic functionality but with enhanced behavior, making them type-3 clones.\"\n}"

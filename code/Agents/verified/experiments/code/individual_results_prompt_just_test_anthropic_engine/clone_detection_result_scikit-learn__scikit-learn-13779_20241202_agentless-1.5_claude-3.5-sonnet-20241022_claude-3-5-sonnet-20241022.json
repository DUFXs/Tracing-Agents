If a step doesn't support sample weights, it raises a ValueError. The code in code sample 2 does essentially the same thing but handles the None check differently - it uses a continue statement to skip None steps instead of combining the checks in one condition.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they perform the same functionality with slightly modified statements. The main difference is in how they handle None steps: Sample 1 uses 'if step is not None and not has_fit_parameter(step, 'sample_weight')' while Sample 2 splits this into two separate conditions with a continue statement ('if step is None: continue' followed by 'if not has_fit_parameter(step, 'sample_weight')'). The core logic and purpose remain the same, but the structure has been modified slightly, which is characteristic of a type-3 clone.\"\n}"

It's used for handling 'isnull' database queries in Django's ORM, with a boolean output field and a custom SQL generation method. While the code in code sample 2 is part of an error handling block that checks for invalid field references in Django model ordering, specifically checking if a field exists and has valid transforms or lookups, and preparing to raise an error message if the field doesn't exist.\",\n    \"is_clone\": false,\n    \"classification\": \"N/A\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve entirely different purposes and have different structures. Sample 1 is a class definition for handling NULL checks in database queries, while sample 2 is an error handling block for validating field references in model ordering. They have different syntactic structures, different logical flows, and different functionalities. They don't share any meaningful similarities in terms of code structure or purpose that would qualify them as any type of clone.\"\n}"

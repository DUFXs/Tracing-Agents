It contains two main branches: one for converting signed integers to unsigned when '_Unsigned' is 'true', and another for converting unsigned integers to signed when '_Unsigned' is 'false'. In both cases, it handles the conversion of '_FillValue' attributes accordingly. The code in code sample 2 contains a subset of the same functionality, specifically the part that handles converting unsigned integers to signed integers when '_Unsigned' is 'false', along with the '_FillValue' conversion.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because code sample 2 is a syntactically similar subset of code sample 1. The main logic for handling unsigned to signed conversion is identical in both samples, but code sample 1 contains additional statements for the reverse conversion (signed to unsigned) that are not present in code sample 2. The core functionality and structure remain similar, but code sample 1 has additional statements, which is characteristic of a type-3 clone. Both samples share the same variable names, conversion logic, and error handling patterns, but one is more comprehensive than the other.\"\n}"

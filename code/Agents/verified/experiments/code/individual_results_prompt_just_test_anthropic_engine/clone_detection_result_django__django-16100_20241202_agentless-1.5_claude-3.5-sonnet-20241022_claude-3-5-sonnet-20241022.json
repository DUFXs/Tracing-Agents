They both contain a transaction block where they iterate through forms in a formset, save changed forms, save related data, construct change messages, log the changes, and keep track of the number of changes. The main structure and purpose of both code blocks is identical - they process and save changes to multiple model instances within a transaction.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically very similar with minor modifications. The main difference is in the transaction.atomic() call, where sample 2 includes an additional parameter 'using=router.db_for_write(self.model)' to specify which database to use for the transaction. Additionally, sample 2 splits the construct_change_message() call across multiple lines for better readability. The core functionality and structure remain the same, but these small modifications make it a type-3 clone rather than type-1 or type-2.\"\n}"

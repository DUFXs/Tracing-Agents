While both deal with indexes in Django's database schema management, sample 1 is focused on constraint validation and filtering specific index constraints, while sample 2 is handling the comparison and deletion of composed indexes based on differences between old and new index sets. The code structure, logic flow, and operations performed are fundamentally different. Sample 1 is doing constraint filtering and validation, while sample 2 is performing set operations and index deletion.\"\n}"

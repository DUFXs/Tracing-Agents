Code sample 2 contains different method implementations: __iter__() which returns an iterator of self.dict, __reversed__() which returns a reversed iterator of self.dict, and __contains__() which checks if an item exists in self.dict.\",\n\"is_clone\": false,\n\"classification\": \"N/A\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they implement different methods with different functionalities, with the exception of the __reversed__() method which appears identically in both samples. While both samples appear to be from the same file and operate on self.dict, they serve different purposes: sample 1 handles length operations and defines an exception, while sample 2 handles iteration and membership testing. The only overlapping code is the __reversed__() method, but this alone doesn't make the entire samples clones of each other.\"\n}"

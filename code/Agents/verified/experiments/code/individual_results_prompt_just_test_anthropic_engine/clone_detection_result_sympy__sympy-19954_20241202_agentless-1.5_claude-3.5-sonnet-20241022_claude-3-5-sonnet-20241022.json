    "response": "{\n    \"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks for minimal block systems by maintaining lists of indices and blocks to remove. It uses separate lists (to_remove and indices_to_remove) to track what needs to be removed, and then removes non-minimal systems by deleting elements from num_blocks and blocks using indices. The code in code sample 2 performs the same minimality check but uses a boolean mask approach (blocks_remove_mask) to track which elements should be removed, and then creates new filtered lists using list comprehensions.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-3\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they perform the same logical operation (removing non-minimal block systems) but use different implementation approaches. The core logic of checking minimality conditions is identical, but the way they handle the removal of non-minimal systems differs: Sample 1 uses explicit index-based deletion while Sample 2 uses a boolean mask and list comprehensions. The modifications include:\n    1. Different data structures for tracking removals (indices vs boolean mask)\n    2. Different removal methods (del statements vs list comprehensions)\n    3. Additional code in Sample 2 for handling num_block not in num_blocks\n    Despite these modifications, the fundamental algorithm and purpose remain the same, making this a type-3 clone.\"\n}"

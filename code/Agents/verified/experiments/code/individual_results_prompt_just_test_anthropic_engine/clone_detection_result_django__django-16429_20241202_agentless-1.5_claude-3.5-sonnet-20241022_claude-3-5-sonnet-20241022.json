The only difference is in the patch header 'index 4a5247a..bd99a92 100644' present in sample 1 but not in sample 2. This difference is merely metadata about the patch and not part of the actual code. The actual code content, including whitespace, layout, and identifiers, is exactly the same in both samples.\"\n}"

The main differences are:\n    1. The condition check is written differently: 'remainder = self.remainder; if remainder not in' vs 'if self.remainder not in'\n    2. Sample 2 has additional context including a super() call and transformer initialization that's not present in sample 1\n    3. The core functionality (setting outputs for transformers and handling the remainder) is the same, but written with slightly modified statements\n    The changes are more than just identifiers or whitespace (ruling out type-1 and type-2), but the code structure and functionality remain similar enough to be considered type-3 clones.\"\n}"

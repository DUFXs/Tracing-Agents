It iterates through self._children, setting artist.axes and artist.figure to None. While the code in sample 2 is doing something similar but in a different context - it's reassigning self._children to an empty list after storing the old children, and then sets the axes and figure attributes to None for each old child. Both snippets are dealing with cleaning up references to axes and figures from child objects.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they perform similar operations (nullifying axes and figure references of child objects) but with slightly different implementations. The core functionality is the same, but sample 1 modifies the existing children directly, while sample 2 creates a new empty list and handles the old children separately. They also have different surrounding context and additional operations. The basic pattern of iterating through children and setting axes/figure to None is present in both, but with modified and additional statements, which is characteristic of type-3 clones.\"\n}"

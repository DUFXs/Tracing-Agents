It specifically handles the final part of digest authentication string construction. The code in code sample 2 contains the same fragment but also includes additional code for calculating digest authentication values (A1, A2, HA1, and HA2) using the username, realm, password, method, and path.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-3\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because code sample 2 contains all the code from sample 1 (the part handling entdig and qop parameters) but has additional statements before it for calculating the digest authentication values. The core functionality in sample 1 is completely contained within sample 2, with sample 2 having additional related statements. This matches the definition of a type-3 clone where there are added statements while maintaining syntactic similarity in the overlapping parts.\"\n}"

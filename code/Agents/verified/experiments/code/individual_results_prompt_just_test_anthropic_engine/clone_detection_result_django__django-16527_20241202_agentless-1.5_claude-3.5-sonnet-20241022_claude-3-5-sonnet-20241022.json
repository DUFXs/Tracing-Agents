Code sample 1 sets 'show_save_as_new' based on conditions including not being in a popup, having change and add permissions, being in change mode, and having save_as enabled. It also sets 'show_save_and_add_another' based on can_save_and_add_another. Code sample 2 does exactly the same thing, with the only difference being that has_change_permission is removed from the conditions for show_save_as_new.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar with only one condition (has_change_permission) removed in the second sample. The overall structure and purpose of the code remains the same, but there is a small modification in the conditions for show_save_as_new. This fits the definition of a type-3 clone where statements can be modified or removed while maintaining the overall similarity.\"\n}"

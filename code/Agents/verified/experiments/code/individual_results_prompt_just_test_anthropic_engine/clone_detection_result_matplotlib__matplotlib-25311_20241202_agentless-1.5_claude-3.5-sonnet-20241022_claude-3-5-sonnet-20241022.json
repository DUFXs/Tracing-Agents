    "response": "{\n\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 implements pickling support for a class by defining __getstate__ and __setstate__ methods. It handles the serialization of object state by removing unpicklable attributes (canvas, background, _last_pos) during pickling and reinitializing them as None during unpickling. The code in code sample 2 appears to be part of a drag-and-drop or interactive artist implementation in matplotlib, setting up event callbacks and handling canvas properties with consideration for pickling.\",\n\"is_clone\": false,\n\"classification\": \"N/A\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve entirely different purposes and have different implementations. While both deal with pickling-related concerns in matplotlib, they do so in different ways: Sample 1 explicitly implements pickle protocol methods to handle object serialization, while Sample 2 implements event handling with pickling considerations in its property definition. The code structure, purpose, and implementation details are fundamentally different. They share only a thematic similarity in dealing with pickling, but are not syntactically or functionally equivalent in any way that would qualify them as code clones.\"\n}"

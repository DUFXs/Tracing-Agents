It specifically handles the case when the script is run using 'python -m package_name' by checking __main__.__spec__ and its parent attribute, then builds the appropriate command line arguments. The code in code sample 2 does essentially the same thing but with a slightly simplified conditional check and different comments.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they have the same basic functionality but with some modifications in the structure. The main differences are:\n1. Sample 1 has a more verbose conditional check: 'if hasattr(__main__, '__spec__') and __main__.__spec__ is not None' followed by a nested if statement\n2. Sample 2 combines these conditions into a single if statement: 'if __main__.__spec__ is not None and __main__.__spec__.parent'\n3. The comments are different between the two versions\n4. Some lines are identical (like the args construction and py_script.exists() check)\nThese modifications maintain the same functionality but with slightly different syntax and structure, making this a type-3 clone.\"\n}"

The common parts are syntactically similar, with a minor difference in the dtype parameter ([np.float64, np.float32] vs np.float64), but code sample 1 has added statements at the end. This matches the definition of a type-3 clone where there are modifications or additions to statements while maintaining some structural similarity.\"\n}"

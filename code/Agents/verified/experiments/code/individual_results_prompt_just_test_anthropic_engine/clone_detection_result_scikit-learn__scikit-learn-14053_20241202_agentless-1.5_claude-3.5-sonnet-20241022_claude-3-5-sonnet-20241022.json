When a feature index is TREE_UNDEFINED, it uses 'undefined' as the name. The code also includes additional functionality for text export and recursive tree printing. The code in code sample 2 performs a similar feature name processing, but handles undefined features differently (using None instead of 'undefined') and has a simpler implementation for the else case without checking for TREE_UNDEFINED.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share the same basic structure and purpose (processing feature names for a decision tree), but have some modified statements and slight behavioral differences. Key differences include: 1) Using 'None' vs 'undefined' for undefined features, 2) The else clause in sample 2 is simpler and doesn't check for TREE_UNDEFINED, 3) Sample 1 contains additional code for text export and tree recursion. The core logic is similar, but there are enough statement modifications and additions/removals to classify this as a type-3 clone rather than type-1 or type-2.\"\n}"

The code in code sample 2 does essentially the same thing but with slightly different structure: it first asserts the parent is a UnitTestCase, creates a 'skipped' variable to store the skip status, and then performs the same tearDown modification if pdb is enabled and the test isn't skipped.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they perform the same functionality but with some modifications in the structure. The core logic is the same (checking if pdb is enabled and test isn't skipped, then modifying tearDown), but sample 2 adds an assertion check and introduces a temporary variable 'skipped' to store the skip status. The main difference is in how they structure the skip check: sample 1 does it inline in the if condition, while sample 2 assigns it to a variable first. The code maintains the same basic functionality but with these small structural modifications, making it a type-3 clone.\"\n}"

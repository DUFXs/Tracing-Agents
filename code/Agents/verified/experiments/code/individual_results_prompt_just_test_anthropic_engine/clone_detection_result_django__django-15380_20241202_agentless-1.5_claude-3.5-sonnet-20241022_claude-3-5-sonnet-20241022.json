The code iterates through new fields that weren't in the old state (using the difference between new_field_keys and old_field_keys), gets the corresponding model states (both old and new), retrieves the field, and prepares for field deconstruction to potentially detect field renames. This is part of Django's schema migration detection process.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-1\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are exactly identical, character for character, including whitespace, variable names, and comments. Even looking at the file path ('django/db/migrations/autodetector.py'), it's clear these are the same piece of code. The only difference is in the patch header ('index 6db1dcc..3005e7e 100644' present in sample 1 but not in sample 2), which is not part of the actual code.\"\n}"

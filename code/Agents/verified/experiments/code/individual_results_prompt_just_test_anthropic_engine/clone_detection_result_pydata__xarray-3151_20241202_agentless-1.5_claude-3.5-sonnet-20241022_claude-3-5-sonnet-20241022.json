It iterates through concat_dims, and for each dimension that was concatenated, it retrieves the indexes and begins to check if they are monotonically increasing (though the condition is cut off). The code in code sample 2 performs a similar check but is more complete - it checks if indexes are either monotonically increasing OR decreasing, raises a ValueError if neither condition is met, and includes additional functionality to append concatenated results and return a merged result.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share the same basic structure and purpose (checking monotonicity of concatenated indexes), but code sample 2 contains additional statements and modifications. Both samples start with the same loop over concat_dims and check indexes, but sample 2 adds: 1) the check for monotonically decreasing indexes, 2) the ValueError raising logic, 3) the append operation, and 4) the merge return statement. The core functionality is similar, but sample 2 has modified and added statements, making this a type-3 clone.\"\n}"

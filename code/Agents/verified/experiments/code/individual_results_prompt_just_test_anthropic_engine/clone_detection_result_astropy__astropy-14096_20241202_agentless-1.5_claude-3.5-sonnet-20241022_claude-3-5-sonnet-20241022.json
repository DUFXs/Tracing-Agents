Sample 1 is focused on attribute lookup in the class dictionary and sky coordinate frame checking, while Sample 2 deals with frame transformation and includes parts of two different methods. While they appear in the same file and are related to attribute handling, they have distinct functionality and aren't structurally or functionally equivalent. The code fragments also appear to be from different parts of the same class implementation, with Sample 2 showing the end of one method and the start of another.\"\n}"

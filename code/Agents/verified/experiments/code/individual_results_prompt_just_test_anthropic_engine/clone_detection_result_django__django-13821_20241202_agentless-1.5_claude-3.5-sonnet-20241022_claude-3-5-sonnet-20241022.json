    "response": "{\n\"explanation\": \"Both code samples define a function 'check_sqlite_version()' that checks if the installed SQLite version is at least 3.9.0. If not, it raises an ImproperlyConfigured exception with a message indicating the found version. Both samples then call this function. The only difference between them is the formatting of the raise statement - in sample 1 it's on a single line, while in sample 2 it's split across multiple lines.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-1\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in terms of functionality, variable names, and logic. The only difference is in the layout/formatting of the code, specifically how the raise statement is formatted (single line vs. multiple lines). This falls under the definition of type-1 clones, which allows for differences in whitespace, layout, and comments.\"\n}"

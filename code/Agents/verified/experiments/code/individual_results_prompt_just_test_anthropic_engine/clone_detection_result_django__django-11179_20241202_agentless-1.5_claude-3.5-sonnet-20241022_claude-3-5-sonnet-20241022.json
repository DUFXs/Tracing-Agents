    "response": "{\n    \"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is a deletion operation in Django that handles both fast deletion and batch deletion cases. It checks if fast deletion is possible for an instance, performs the deletion, sets the primary key to None, and handles the deletion within a transaction. It also includes a loop for handling multiple instances and returns deletion counts. The code in code sample 2 contains the same fast deletion logic but is missing the loop for handling multiple instances and the final return statement.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-3\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because code sample 2 is a subset of code sample 1, containing the same core logic for fast deletion but missing some statements. The first part of both samples (the fast deletion check and execution) is identical, but code sample 1 has additional statements for handling multiple instances and returning results. This fits the definition of a type-3 clone where statements can be added or removed while maintaining syntactic similarity in the shared portions.\"\n}"

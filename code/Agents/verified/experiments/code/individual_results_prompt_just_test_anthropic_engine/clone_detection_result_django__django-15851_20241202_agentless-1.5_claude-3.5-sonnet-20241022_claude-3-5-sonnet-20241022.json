It constructs command-line arguments for connecting to a PostgreSQL database by adding host, port, database name, and other parameters.

The parts that are present in both samples are identical, but code sample 1 has additional statements. This matches the definition of type-3 clones where code can be syntactically similar with added, modified, or removed statements.\"\n}"

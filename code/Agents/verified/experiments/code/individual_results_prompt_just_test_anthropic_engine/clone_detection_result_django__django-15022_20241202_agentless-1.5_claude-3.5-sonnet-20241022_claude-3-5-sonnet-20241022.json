It constructs OR queries for each search term and combines them with AND operations. The query is built by directly adding Q objects to an or_queries variable and then applying the filter to the queryset. The code in code sample 2 also performs a search operation but handles the query construction differently by collecting individual term queries in a list and then combining them at the end using models.Q(*term_queries).\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they have the same basic structure and purpose (searching using Django Q objects), but differ in how they construct and combine the queries. Both samples:\n1. Check for search_fields and search_term\n2. Construct orm_lookups\n3. Process search terms with smart_split\n4. Handle quoted strings\n5. Create queries using orm_lookups\nHowever, they differ in their implementation approach:\n- Sample 1 uses or_queries.add() and combines with AND connector directly\n- Sample 2 collects queries in a term_queries list and combines them at the end\nThese modifications maintain the same overall functionality but with slightly different implementation details, making them type-3 clones.\"\n}"

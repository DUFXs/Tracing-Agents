The code in code sample 2 shows a similar structure but starts with a different context (appears to be handling fieldsets), has the same 'get_inlines' method, includes a 'get_ordering' method signature, and then has the identical 'get_inline_instances' implementation.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share significant similar code segments, particularly the 'get_inlines' method and 'get_inline_instances' implementation, but have some differences in surrounding context and additional/modified statements. Both samples contain the exact same 'get_inlines' method with identical docstring and implementation, and both have the same beginning of 'get_inline_instances'. However, they differ in their surrounding context - sample 1 has a '__str__' method while sample 2 has code related to fieldsets and a 'get_ordering' method. This makes them syntactically similar with modifications, which is characteristic of type-3 clones.\"\n}"

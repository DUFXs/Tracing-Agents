The code in code sample 2 does the same operation but more concisely, directly wrapping the _imp_ call and its evaluated arguments in a Float constructor.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they perform the same fundamental operation (evaluating a function and returning a Float result with specified precision) but with slightly different structure. Sample 1 uses intermediate steps with conditional logic (checking hasattr(result, 'evalf')), while sample 2 consolidates the operation into a single line. The core functionality is the same, but statements have been modified and consolidated. Also note that sample 2 uses 'i' instead of 'arg' in the list comprehension, but this is a minor difference. The key difference is in the structure of how they handle the result, making this a type-3 clone rather than type-1 or type-2.\"\n}"

The code iterates through app labels and their associated models, checking migration permissions using router.allow_migrate() and then performs a consistency check on the migration history using loader.check_consistent_history(). The code is part of Django's makemigrations command.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-1\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are exactly identical, including whitespace and comments. The only difference is in the patch header 'index bea18af..b0161d6 100644' which appears in sample 1 but not in sample 2. This difference is not part of the actual code content, but rather metadata about the patch itself.\"\n}"

It then replaces spaces with this kernel and checks if the kernel is in the resulting string.

They share the core functionality of the while loop for kernel generation, space replacement, and hit checking, but code sample 1 includes additional context (imports, initial variable declarations) while code sample 2 adds an else clause not present in sample 1. This matches the definition of type-3 clones where there are added, modified, or removed statements while maintaining syntactic similarity in the overlapping parts.\"\n}"

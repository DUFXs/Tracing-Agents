    "response": "{\n\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 iterates through positions in reverse order (from first_dum_pos-1 to 0) and for each position, it inserts free_pos[i] at the beginning of each list in resulting_indices. It also contains some additional code related to handling a variable 't'. The code in code sample 2 creates a new list of resulting_indices by concatenating the slice of free_pos from 0 to first_dum_pos with each existing ri in resulting_indices.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they achieve the same goal of combining elements from free_pos with resulting_indices, but they do it in slightly different ways. Sample 1 uses a loop to insert elements one by one at the beginning of each list, while Sample 2 uses list comprehension with concatenation to achieve the same result. The core functionality is the same, but the implementation approach differs. Additionally, Sample 1 contains extra code related to 't' that's not present in Sample 2, which is characteristic of type-3 clones where statements can be added or removed while maintaining similar functionality.\"\n}"

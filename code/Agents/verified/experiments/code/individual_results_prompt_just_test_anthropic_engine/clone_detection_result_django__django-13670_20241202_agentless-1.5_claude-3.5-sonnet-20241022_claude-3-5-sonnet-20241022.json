The core functionality of the y() method is exactly the same in both samples, using the same formula '%02d' % (self.data.year % 100) to format the two-digit year. The Y() method signature is also identical in both samples. The only difference is in how the documentation is formatted, which falls under the type-1 clone definition of differences in comments.\"\n}"

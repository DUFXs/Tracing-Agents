The code in code sample 2 shows a similar reduce method that checks if an operation is an instance of either AlterField or RemoveField and if it's the same field operation, returning [operation] if true.

Both samples check for operations being instances of certain classes, verify if it's the same field operation, and return [operation] if conditions are met. They also both include the start of a RenameField check. The core logic is the same, but sample 2 has a modified condition that includes an additional operation type.\"\n}"

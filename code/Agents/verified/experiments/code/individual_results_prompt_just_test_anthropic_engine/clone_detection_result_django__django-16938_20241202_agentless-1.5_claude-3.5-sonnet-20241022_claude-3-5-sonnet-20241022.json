The code in code sample 2 shows a queryset_iterator function definition that appears in two different Django serializer files (python.py and xml_serializer.py), which returns an iterator for a specific field's related objects using select_related() and only() methods.\",\n\"is_clone\": false,\n\"classification\": \"N/A\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve completely different purposes and have different structures. Sample 1 is a series of conditional checks returning boolean values, while Sample 2 is a function definition that creates an iterator for querying related objects. They have different syntax, different functionality, and operate on different aspects of Django's ORM system. The only commonality is that they both deal with Django's database operations, but their implementations and purposes are entirely distinct.\"\n}"

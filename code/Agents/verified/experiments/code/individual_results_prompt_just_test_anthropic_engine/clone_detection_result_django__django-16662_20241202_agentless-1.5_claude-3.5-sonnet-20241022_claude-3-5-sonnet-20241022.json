Sample 1 uses explicit list comprehensions to separate and sort the imports into two groups, while Sample 2 uses a single sorted operation with a lambda function. The core functionality is the same, but the implementation details and statements are modified. Both samples end with the same operation of joining the sorted imports with newlines and handling migration_imports. The structural similarity is present but with modified statements in between.\"\n}"

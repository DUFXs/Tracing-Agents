It tries to convert the 'other' value to a sympy object, handles Boolean comparisons, and checks for irrational NumberSymbols. The code in code sample 2 is also part of an equality comparison method but includes additional functionality for comparing mpf (multiple precision floating-point) values and has additional method definitions.\",\n\"is_clone\": false,\n\"classification\": \"N/A\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because while they share some common code segments (the initial _sympify conversion, Boolean check, and the 'if not self' condition), code sample 2 contains significant additional functionality not present in sample 1. Specifically, sample 2 includes mpf comparison logic (using _as_mpf_val and mlib.mpf_eq), and contains part of a not-equals method definition. The differences are too substantial to classify these as clones of any type, as they appear to be different parts of related but distinct comparison methods.\"\n}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"Both code samples are from Django's formsets.py and handle form field creation. They both contain logic for adding deletion fields to a form based on certain conditions. The code checks if deletion is allowed (self.can_delete) and if either deletion of extra forms is allowed (self.can_delete_extra) or if the current form index is less than the initial form count. If these conditions are met, it adds a BooleanField named DELETION_FIELD_NAME to the form with a 'Delete' label.\", \n\"is_clone\": true, \n\"classification\": \"type-1\", \n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in terms of functionality, variable names, and structure. The only difference is in the formatting of the if condition: Code sample 1 has the condition on a single line, while Code sample 2 splits it across multiple lines for better readability. This is purely a layout difference, which is characteristic of type-1 clones.\"}"

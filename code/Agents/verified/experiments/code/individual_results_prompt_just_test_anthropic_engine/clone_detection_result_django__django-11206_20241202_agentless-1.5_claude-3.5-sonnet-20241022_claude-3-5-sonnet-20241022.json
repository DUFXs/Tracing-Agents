    "response": "{\n\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 handles number formatting for very large numbers (with more than 200 digits) by converting them to scientific notation and includes logic for handling decimal positions and zero padding. The code also includes parts for formatting the integer portion of a number. The code in code sample 2 handles the initialization of number formatting, including sign handling and a specific case for small decimal numbers that fall below a certain cutoff value based on decimal position. Both samples contain a common check for numbers with more than 200 digits.\",\n\"is_clone\": false,\n\"classification\": \"N/A\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they handle different aspects of number formatting. While they share some common code (specifically the line checking for number.as_tuple() and the 200-digit threshold comment), they serve different purposes within the same file. Sample 1 focuses on the actual formatting of large numbers and handling decimal positions, while Sample 2 focuses on initialization and handling very small numbers. The overlapping line appears to be part of the same feature but the surrounding context and functionality is different.\"\n}"

    "response": "{\n    \"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 performs validation checks on coordinates, including checking for nonzero coordinates beyond a dimension, validating that coordinates are valid SymPy expressions, and checking for imaginary coordinates using 'im(a)'. It also includes additional functionality to convert Floats to rationals and simplify expressions. The code in code sample 2 performs similar validation checks but uses a slightly different condition for checking imaginary coordinates with 'im(a).is_zero is False' and doesn't include the Float conversion and simplification functionality.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-3\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share the same basic structure and purpose (coordinate validation), with some statements modified or removed. Both check for nonzero coordinates, validate SymPy expressions, and check for imaginary coordinates, but with slightly different implementations. The main differences are: 1) The imaginary coordinate check is written differently (though functionally similar), and 2) Sample 1 has additional code for Float conversion and simplification that's not present in Sample 2. These modifications while maintaining similar functionality make this a type-3 clone.\"\n}"

The code checks if the symbols (syms) are different from variables (var), creates a dictionary mapping symbols to their indices, transforms solution tuples based on this mapping, and returns the result. If the equation's numerator is a number after separating numerator and denominator, it returns an empty set.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-1\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are exactly identical, character by character, including whitespace, layout, and all identifiers. The patches show the same code being added or modified in the same file (sympy/solvers/diophantine.py). There are no differences whatsoever between the two code samples.\"\n}"

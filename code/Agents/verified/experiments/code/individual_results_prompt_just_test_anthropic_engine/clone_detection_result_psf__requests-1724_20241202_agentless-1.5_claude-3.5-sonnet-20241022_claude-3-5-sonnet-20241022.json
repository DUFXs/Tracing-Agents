The core functionality is identical, but there are differences in how the method is processed before being passed to the Request constructor (str(method).upper() vs method.upper() where method is already converted to builtin_str). The differences are in identifier names and the way the string conversion is handled, but the underlying logic and structure remain the same. Both samples are performing the same operation of creating a Request object with an uppercase method parameter.\"\n}"

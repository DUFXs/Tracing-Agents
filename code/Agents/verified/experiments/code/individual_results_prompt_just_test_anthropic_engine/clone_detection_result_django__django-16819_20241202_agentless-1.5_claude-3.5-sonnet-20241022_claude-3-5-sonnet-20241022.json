    "response": "{\n    \"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains two methods: migration_name_fragment() and reduce() for what appears to be index operations in Django migrations. It includes a more detailed implementation of reduce() that checks for RemoveIndex operations and compares both model_name_lower and index.name. It also contains additional classes (RemoveIndex and RenameIndex) with their own implementations. The code in code sample 2 contains the same migration_name_fragment() method but has a simpler version of reduce() that only checks for RemoveIndex and compares index.name, without the model_name_lower comparison.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-3\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they contain the same basic structure and functionality but with modifications. Both have the migration_name_fragment() method that's identical, and both have a reduce() method that handles index operations. However, code sample 1 includes additional checks (model_name_lower comparison) and contains more classes and implementations. The reduce() method in sample 2 is a simplified version of the one in sample 1, with some statements removed but maintaining similar functionality. This matches the definition of a type-3 clone where the code is syntactically similar but has modified statements.\"\n}"

The code in code sample 2 is a larger section that includes mode-specific processing ('psd', 'magnitude', 'angle', 'phase', 'complex') and contains the exact same scaling operations and time array calculation as sample 1.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because code sample 2 contains all the statements from code sample 1 (the scaling operations and time array calculation) but has additional statements for mode-specific processing. The core functionality of scaling the result using window calculations is present in both samples, but sample 2 has added statements for handling different modes before performing these calculations. This fits the definition of a type-3 clone where there are added statements while maintaining syntactic similarity in the shared portions.\"\n}"

They both return an error message when a field doesn't exist, formatting the message with four parameters: label, field_name, the class name of the object, and the model's meta label. The only difference between them is in how the error message string is split - in sample 1 it's one long string, while in sample 2 it's split into two strings that will be concatenated.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-1\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in functionality and structure, with the only difference being in string formatting layout. In sample 1, the error message is written as a single string, while in sample 2, it's split into two strings. This is purely a formatting difference that doesn't affect the final output, as Python automatically concatenates adjacent string literals. All variables, function calls, and logic remain exactly the same between both samples.\"\n}"

The code in code sample 2 does essentially the same thing, defining the same dictionary mapping compression formats to MIME types, with added comments explaining that encoding isn't set to prevent browsers from automatically uncompressing files.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-1\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they contain the exact same dictionary mapping and .get() operation, with only differences in:\n1. Whitespace/layout (different indentation and line ordering of the dictionary entries)\n2. Comments (sample 2 has additional explanatory comments)\n3. Sample 1 has an additional line setting the Content-Type header\nThe core logic and structure of the code is identical, and the differences are only in formatting and comments, which is characteristic of type-1 clones.\"\n}"

The core serialize_result method is identical in both samples, returning the same dictionary structure with 'id' and 'text' fields. The JsonResponse structure is also identical. However, sample 1 includes a has_perm method for permission checking, while sample 2 includes a get_paginator method and additional documentation in the get method. These differences in added/removed statements while maintaining the core functionality makes this a type-3 clone.\"\n}"

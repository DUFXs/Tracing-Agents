The code extracts a parameter and value from a keyword argument dictionary using popitem(), then checks if the parameter is not in the expected parameters, keyword-only parameters, and no variable keyword arguments are allowed. If these conditions are met, it raises a TemplateSyntaxError with a message indicating an unexpected keyword argument was received.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-1\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are exactly identical in terms of code content, including whitespace and comments.

The code in code sample 2 does the same thing but uses a more concise dictionary merge syntax with **.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-3\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they perform the same functionality but with slightly modified statements. Both methods check a condition and set the 'checked' attribute in a dictionary before calling the parent's get_context, but they differ in how they construct the dictionary. Sample 1 uses an if-else with dictionary copy, while sample 2 uses dictionary unpacking with the ** operator. The logical structure and outcome are the same, but the implementation details vary slightly. This makes them type-3 clones as they have syntactically similar structure with modified statements but maintain the same functionality.\"\n}"

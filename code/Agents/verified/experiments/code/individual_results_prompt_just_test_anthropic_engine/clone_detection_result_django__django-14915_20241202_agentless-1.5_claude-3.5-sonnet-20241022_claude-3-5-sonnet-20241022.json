However, they have some differences in the statements included: Sample 1 has a ModelChoiceIterator class definition that's not in Sample 2, while Sample 2 has a __str__ method that's not in Sample 1. The equality comparison logic appears in both but in different positions. This matches the definition of type-3 clones where there are syntactically similar elements with added, modified, or removed statements.\"\n}"

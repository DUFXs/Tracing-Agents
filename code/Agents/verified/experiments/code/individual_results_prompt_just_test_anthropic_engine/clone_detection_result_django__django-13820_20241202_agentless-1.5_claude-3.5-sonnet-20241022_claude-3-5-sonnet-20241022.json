The core logic is the same:\n1. Both check if getattr(module, '__file__', None) is None\n2. Both verify that the module's __path__ is not a list\n3. Both add app_config.label to unmigrated_apps\n4. Both include a continue statement\n\nHowever, there are differences:\n1. Code sample 2 has additional surrounding context and functionality (module reloading)\n2. The condition is structured differently (single line vs. multi-line with parentheses)\n3. Code sample 2 has more detailed comments explaining namespace packages\n4. Code sample 2 directly accesses module.__path__ while sample 1 uses getattr()\n\nThese modifications make this a type-3 clone rather than type-1 or type-2.\"\n}"

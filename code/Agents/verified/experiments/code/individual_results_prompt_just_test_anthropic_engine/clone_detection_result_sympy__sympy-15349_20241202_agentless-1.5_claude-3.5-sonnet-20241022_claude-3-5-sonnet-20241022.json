It includes calculations for matrix elements m10 through m21, and also includes m33=1 and a return statement with a 4x4 matrix construction.

This matches the definition of type-3 clones where the code is syntactically similar but has added or removed statements. The fundamental mathematical operations are identical where they overlap, but sample 1 has extra functionality.\"\n}"

While the code in code sample 2 defines a similar keep_attrs lambda function but instead returns the attrs attribute of variable x using getattr, defaulting to an empty dictionary if the attribute doesn't exist. Both code samples appear to be part of a larger function that uses apply_ufunc.\", \n\"is_clone\": true, \n\"classification\": \"type-3\", \n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they have similar syntactic structure (both define a keep_attrs lambda function and both have the same comment about keeping attributes) but have modified statements. The key difference is in how they retrieve the attributes: sample 1 uses list indexing (attrs[1] if len(attrs) > 1 else {}), while sample 2 uses getattr (getattr(x, 'attrs', {})). Additionally, sample 2 has extra code at the beginning checking if keep_attrs is None. The core functionality appears to be similar (getting attributes with a fallback to empty dict), but the implementation details differ.\"\n}"

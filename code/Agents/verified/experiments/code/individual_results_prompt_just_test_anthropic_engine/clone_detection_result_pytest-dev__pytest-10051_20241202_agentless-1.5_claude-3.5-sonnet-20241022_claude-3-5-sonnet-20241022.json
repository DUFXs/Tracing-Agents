While both are related to logging functionality, sample 1 is focused on retrieving records based on a condition, while sample 2 contains multiple distinct functionalities including clearing logs, handling errors, and setting log levels. The code structures are fundamentally different, and they serve different purposes within the logging system. Even though there might be some conceptual relationship between them (both deal with logging), they cannot be considered clones of any type.\"\n}"

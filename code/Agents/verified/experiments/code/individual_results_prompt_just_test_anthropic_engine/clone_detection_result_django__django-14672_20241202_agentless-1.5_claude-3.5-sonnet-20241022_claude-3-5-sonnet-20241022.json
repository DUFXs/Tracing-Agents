The code in code sample 2 contains only the identity method implementation, which returns the same tuple construction as the first part of code sample 1.\",\n    \"is_clone\": false,\n    \"classification\": \"N/A\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because while code sample 2 is completely contained within code sample 1, code sample 1 contains additional functionality (the field relationship checking code) that is not present in code sample 2. The identity method implementations are identical, but code sample 1 includes more code that serves a different purpose. For code samples to be considered clones, they should represent the same functionality or structure, which is not the case here as one contains substantially more code with different purposes.\"\n}"

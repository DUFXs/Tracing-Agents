It sets report outcomes to 'failed' for unexpected successes, handles xfail exceptions by setting the outcome to 'skipped', and processes xfailed tests based on various conditions. The code in sample 2 handles a different part of the test execution flow, setting the outcome to 'passed' and handling skipped tests with specific conditions related to mark keys and report properties.\",\n    \"is_clone\": false,\n    \"classification\": \"N/A\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they handle different logical branches and functionality within the pytest skipping module. While they both deal with test outcomes, they have different control flows, handle different conditions, and serve different purposes. Sample 1 focuses on xfail handling and unexpected success scenarios, while sample 2 deals with passed outcomes and skipped test conditions. The code structure, logic, and purpose are fundamentally different, and they cannot be considered clones of any type.\"\n}"

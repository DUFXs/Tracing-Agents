    "response": "{\n\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 creates a Rectangle object based on the axis bounds, with different behavior depending on whether the direction is 'horizontal' or 'vertical'. For horizontal direction, it uses x-axis transform and bounds, while for vertical it uses y-axis transform and bounds. The code in code sample 2 sets up edge handles for a widget, also using axis bounds based on direction (horizontal or vertical), but creates ToolLineHandles instead of a Rectangle.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share similar structural patterns and logic flow: both check for horizontal/vertical direction, both access axis bounds conditionally based on that direction (get_xbound/get_ybound), and both create visual elements using those bounds. However, they differ in their specific implementation - one creates a Rectangle while the other creates ToolLineHandles. They also have some modified statements and different property assignments, but maintain the core similar structure and conditional logic based on direction.\"\n}"

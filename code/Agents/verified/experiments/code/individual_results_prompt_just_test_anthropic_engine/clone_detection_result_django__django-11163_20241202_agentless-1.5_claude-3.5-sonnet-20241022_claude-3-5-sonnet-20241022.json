The code appears to be part of Django's form handling system, specifically for processing model fields.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are exactly identical in terms of code content, logic, and structure. The only difference appears to be in the patch metadata (the 'index 0d7da3d..74a2377 100644' line in sample 1), which is not part of the actual code. The actual code fragments, including whitespace and layout, are completely identical.\"}"

While both deal with type checking and conversion of DataArray objects, they do so in different contexts and with different end goals. Sample 1 is part of a broader type conversion routine that handles multiple object types, while Sample 2 is specifically focused on preparing objects for a merge operation. The logic flow, structure, and purpose are fundamentally different, even though they share some similar concepts about handling DataArray objects.\"\n}"

The code in sample 2 appears to be handling a different logic flow involving checking the length of arguments (args) and non-zero elements (nz), returning True if z equals the length of args, returning None under certain length conditions, and then creating a new function call with non-zero elements.\",\n    \"is_clone\": false,\n    \"classification\": \"N/A\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they perform different logical operations and have different control flows. While they both contain some similar elements (like checking for zero and returning boolean/None values), their overall structure and purpose appear to be different. Sample 1 is focused on checking a single variable 'b' and its relationship to other variables, while sample 2 is dealing with argument lengths and creating new function calls. The only overlapping part is the 'if b.is_zero' check, but the context and surrounding logic are completely different.\"\n}"

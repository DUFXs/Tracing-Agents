The code appears to be part of a file processing pipeline in Sphinx's code directive implementation.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-1\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are exactly identical, containing the same code with the same whitespace, layout, and even file path ('sphinx/directives/code.py'). The only difference is in the patch format representation where sample 1 includes 'index 2bf31d0..acff924 100644' in the header, which is metadata about the patch itself and not part of the actual code.\"\n}"

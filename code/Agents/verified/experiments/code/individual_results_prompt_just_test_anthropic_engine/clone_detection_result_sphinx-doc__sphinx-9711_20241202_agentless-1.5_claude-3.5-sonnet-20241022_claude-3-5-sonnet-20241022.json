It raises a VersionRequirementError if the loaded extension version doesn't meet the required version. The code in code sample 2 performs the same version requirement check but with more robust error handling and version comparison logic, using the Version class and handling InvalidVersion exceptions.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they perform the same fundamental functionality (checking extension version requirements) but with modified statements and additional error handling. The second sample adds more sophisticated version comparison logic with try-except blocks and explicit Version class usage, while maintaining the same basic control flow and error messaging. The core functionality remains the same, but the implementation details and robustness of the version comparison have been modified and enhanced.\"\n}\n\nThe key differences that make this a type-3 clone are:\n1. Sample 1 uses simple parse() function calls for version comparison\n2. Sample 2 introduces a 'fulfilled' flag variable\n3. Sample 2 adds try-except blocks to handle InvalidVersion exceptions\n4. Sample 2 has additional logic paths for version comparison\n5. Both samples maintain the same basic purpose and raise the same type of error with identical error messages\n6. The core functionality (version requirement checking) remains the same despite the implementation differences\n\nThese modifications represent the kind of statement additions and modifications that characterize type-3 clones, while preserving the fundamental purpose and behavior of the code."

The code in code sample 2 shows the end of the same None-value removal loop and then creates a new dictionary comprehension that accomplishes the same task (filtering out None values) in a different way.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-3\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they both accomplish the same task of removing None values from a dictionary, but use different syntactical approaches. Sample 1 uses an iterative approach with a for loop and del statement, while sample 2 includes both this approach and adds a dictionary comprehension that achieves the same result. The addition of the dictionary comprehension makes this a type-3 clone, as it's a modified version of the same logic with added statements but maintaining similar functionality.\"\n}"

The code checks for different values of 'combine_attrs' and performs different actions: if it's 'drop', returns an empty dictionary; if it's 'override', returns a dictionary of the first variable's attributes; if it's 'no_conflicts', it starts creating a result dictionary from the first variable's attributes and begins a loop to process additional attributes.\",\n    \"is_clone\": true,\n    \"classification\": \"type-1\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are exactly identical, including the same variable names, control flow, and logic. The only difference appears to be in the file path specification in the patch format ('index 1328b95..5caed6a 100644' is present in sample 1 but not in sample 2), which is metadata and not part of the actual code. The code content itself is character-for-character identical, making this a clear type-1 clone.\"\n}"

The code wraps the save operation in a transaction.atomic() block and handles potential IntegrityError exceptions. The code in both samples: 1) assigns a new model name to content_type.model, 2) attempts to save the content type within a transaction using a specific database, and 3) includes exception handling for IntegrityError with a comment about graceful fallback.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-1\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are exactly identical in terms of code content, structure, and even comments. The only difference appears to be in the patch metadata (index 1e6250e..ae897f9 100644\\n) which is present in sample 1 but not in sample 2. This difference is not part of the actual code and relates to version control information, so it doesn't affect the clone classification. The actual code content, whitespace, layout, and comments are identical between both samples.\"\n}"

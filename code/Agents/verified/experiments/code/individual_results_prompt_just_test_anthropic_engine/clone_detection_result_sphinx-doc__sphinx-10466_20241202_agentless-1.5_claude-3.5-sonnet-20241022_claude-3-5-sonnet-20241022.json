Sample 1 is a constructor that initializes object attributes, while Sample 2 is an iterator that processes and yields Message objects. While both deal with similar data structures (locations/positions and uuids), their syntactic structure and functional purpose are fundamentally different. Sample 1 focuses on object initialization and duplicate removal, while Sample 2 focuses on iteration and data transformation.

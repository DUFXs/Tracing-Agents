When setting a new query, it checks if the value has values_select and annotation_select attributes, and updates the corresponding instance attributes (_fields, _iterable_class, and annotation_select). The code in code sample 2 is also a query setter method but with simplified logic - it only sets the _iterable_class if values_select exists and then sets the query value.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share the same basic structure (query setter method) and some identical statements, but code sample 1 has additional statements and logic. Specifically:\n1. Both have the @query.setter decorator and basic query setting functionality\n2. Both check for values_select and set _iterable_class\n3. However, code sample 1 has additional functionality:\n   - Sets self._fields with the values_select list\n   - Checks for and sets annotation_select\nThe differences are modifications and additions to the basic functionality, making this a type-3 clone.\"\n}"

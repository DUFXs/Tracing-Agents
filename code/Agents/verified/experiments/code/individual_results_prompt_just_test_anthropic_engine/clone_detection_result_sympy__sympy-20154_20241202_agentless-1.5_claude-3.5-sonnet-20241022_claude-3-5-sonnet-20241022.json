The code manipulates a collection using keys and room variables, yielding either a sum of values and a copy of 'ms' or just a copy of 'ms' depending on a 'size' parameter. Both samples end with the same function declaration for 'ordered_partitions'. The only difference is that sample 2 includes some additional documentation/comments at the beginning showing example outputs and a 'References' section.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-1\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they contain exactly the same code with identical identifiers, operations, and logic. The only difference between them is that sample 2 includes additional documentation comments at the beginning. Type-1 clones are defined as being identical except for differences in whitespace, layout, and comments, which is exactly what we see here. The actual functional code portions are byte-for-byte identical.\"\n}"

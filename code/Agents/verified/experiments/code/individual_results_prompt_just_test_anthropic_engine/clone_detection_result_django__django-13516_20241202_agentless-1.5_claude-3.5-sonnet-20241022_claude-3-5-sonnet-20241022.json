While the code in sample 2 defines two methods: a __getattr__ method for attribute delegation and a flush method that checks if the underlying output stream has a flush method before calling it.\",\n    \"is_clone\": false,\n    \"classification\": \"N/A\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes and have different functionality. While both samples deal with output stream operations, sample 1 is focused on writing styled messages and flushing, while sample 2 implements attribute delegation and a more defensive flush operation with additional checks. The code structure, purpose, and implementation are fundamentally different. Sample 2 also includes an additional isatty method which is not present in sample 1. The only common element is the flush operation, but it's implemented differently in each case.\"\n}"

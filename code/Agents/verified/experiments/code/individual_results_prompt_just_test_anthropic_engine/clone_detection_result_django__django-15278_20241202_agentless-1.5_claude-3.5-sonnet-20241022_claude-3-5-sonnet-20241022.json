It also includes a _collate_sql method. The code in code sample 2 is also handling field addition in SQLite, checking similar conditions (primary key, unique constraint, not null, or default value) to determine whether to remake the table or use the parent implementation.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share the same basic structure and purpose (checking conditions to decide whether to remake a table or use super().add_field), but have some differences in their conditions and statements. The main differences are: 1) Sample 2 includes additional checks for primary_key and unique fields, 2) Sample 1 includes a check for one_to_one fields, and 3) Sample 1 has an additional _remake_table call in the else clause. The core logic and most of the conditions are the same, but there are these added and modified statements, making this a type-3 clone. Both pieces of code are clearly derived from the same source and serve the same purpose, just with slightly different implementation details.\"\n}"

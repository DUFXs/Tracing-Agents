The code in code sample 2 also performs a copy operation of a form field object, but uses a slightly different approach for error_messages by using the copy() method instead of deepcopy.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they have the same basic structure and purpose (copying a form field object), but there are minor modifications in how they handle the copying of error_messages. Sample 1 uses 'copy.deepcopy(self.error_messages, memo)' while sample 2 uses 'self.error_messages.copy()'. Additionally, sample 2 starts with 'result = copy.copy(self)' which isn't shown in sample 1's snippet. The core functionality remains the same, but there are these small modifications in the implementation, which is characteristic of type-3 clones.\"\n}"

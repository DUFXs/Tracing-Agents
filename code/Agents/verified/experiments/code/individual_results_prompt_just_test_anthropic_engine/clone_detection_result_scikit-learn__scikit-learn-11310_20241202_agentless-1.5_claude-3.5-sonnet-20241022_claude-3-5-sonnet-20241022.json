    "response": "{\n\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 measures the time taken to refit the best model by storing the start time, performing the model fitting operation (either with or without y parameter), and then calculating the total time taken by subtracting the start time from the current time. The code in code sample 2 does essentially the same thing, measuring the refit time of the best model, but uses different variable names (refit_start_time and refit_end_time instead of start_time) and includes additional documentation about the refit_time_ attribute.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-2\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they perform exactly the same operations with the same logic and structure, but use different variable names. In sample 1, the timing variables are named 'start_time' and the calculation is done directly with 'time.time() - start_time', while in sample 2, the variables are named 'refit_start_time' and 'refit_end_time' with the calculation done as 'refit_end_time - refit_start_time'. The core functionality of timing the model refit operation remains identical, with only identifier names being different. The additional documentation in sample 2 doesn't affect the clone classification as comments are ignored in type-2 clone detection.\"\n}"

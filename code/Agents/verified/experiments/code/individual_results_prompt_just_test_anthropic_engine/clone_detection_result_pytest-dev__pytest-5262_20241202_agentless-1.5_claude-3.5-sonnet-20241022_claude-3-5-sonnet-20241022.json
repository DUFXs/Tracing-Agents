It also includes a __getattr__ method for attribute delegation.

The removal of comments (docstring)\n2. A minor difference in string quotes ('b' vs \\\"b\\\")\n3. Some whitespace variations\nThese differences fall under the definition of type-1 clones, which allows for differences in whitespace, layout, and comments while maintaining identical code structure and functionality.\"\n}"

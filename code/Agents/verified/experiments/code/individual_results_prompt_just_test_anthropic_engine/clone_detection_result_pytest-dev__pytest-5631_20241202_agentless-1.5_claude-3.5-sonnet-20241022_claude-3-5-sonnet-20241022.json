The core logic is the same - both use list comprehension to filter patchings based on attribute_name and sentinel values. However, sample 2 has modified statements to handle mock sentinels differently, checking explicitly for both 'mock' and 'unittest.mock' modules instead of using the any() function with mock_modules. The basic structure and purpose remain the same, but there are added and modified statements, making this a type-3 clone.\"\n}"

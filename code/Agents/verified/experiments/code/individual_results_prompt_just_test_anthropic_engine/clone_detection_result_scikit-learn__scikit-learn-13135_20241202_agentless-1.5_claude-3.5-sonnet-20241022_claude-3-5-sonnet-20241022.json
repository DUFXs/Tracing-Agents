The code in code sample 2 does the same k-means clustering, but explicitly sorts the centers after they're computed with an additional sort() operation, before calculating the bin edges.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they perform the same fundamental operation (k-means clustering and bin edge calculation) but have a slight modification in how the sorting is handled. In sample 1, the sorting is done using np.sort() during the centers computation, while sample 2 adds an explicit centers.sort() statement after computing the centers. This represents a modified statement while maintaining the same overall functionality, which is characteristic of a type-3 clone. The rest of the code, including the bin edge calculations, remains identical.\"\n}"

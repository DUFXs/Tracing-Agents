The code in code sample 2 also iterates through variables and creates a dictionary, but directly adds the selected and squeezed data to the dictionary without checking the size.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they have the same basic structure and purpose (creating a dictionary from selected and squeezed data), but code sample 1 includes additional statements for size checking (if var_data.size > 0) that are not present in code sample 2. The size check in sample 1 adds a condition for including data in the dictionary, while sample 2 includes all data unconditionally. This represents a modification of statements while maintaining similar syntactic structure, which is characteristic of type-3 clones.\"\n}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 overrides the __getattr__ method to provide custom behavior for accessing attributes of a SkyCoord object, specifically handling the case where attributes are related to a frame. It also overrides __setattr__ to ensure that modification of certain attributes remains immutable. The code in code sample 2 contains a similar context where it suggests behavior relating to attribute access in the context of transformations and exception handling when accessing attributes. It also features an incomplete method definition for __setattr__ but does not include the full context of the class or the detailed custom behavior seen in code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because, while they may relate to similar methods and concepts within the same class, they differentiate significantly in content and context, displaying different behavior and potentially serving different function requirements.\"}"

Both snippets involve checking data types with 'arrb.dtype, np.floating' and comparing arrays using 'where_not_allclose', particularly for handling formats 'P' and 'Q' in a variable-length array context. The difference is that sample 1 includes additional context about a '.gitignore' file for generated files, while the second sample does not include this context.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for the whitespace and layout differences in how they are presented, with the additional data related to the '.gitignore' file in the first sample.\"}"

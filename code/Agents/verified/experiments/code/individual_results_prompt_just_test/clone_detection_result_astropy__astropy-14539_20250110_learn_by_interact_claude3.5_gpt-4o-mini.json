    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 processes two arrays (arra and arrb), checking for differences in elements between them based on their data types. It identifies indices where the shapes of the elements do not match and applies different comparison methods for floating-point and non-floating-point arrays. The result is stored in the diffs variable. Code sample 2 presents part of a similar structure, where it handles situations where the format 'P' or 'Q' is in col.format, indicating a scenario where indices of differing elements need to be created, but it does not include complete implementation or checks found in sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they differ not only in layout but also in logic and functionality, with the second sample being incomplete in terms of the logic presented in the first.\"}"

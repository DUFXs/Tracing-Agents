    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function that computes a coordinate matrix ('cright') based on certain conditions and combines it with another matrix ('cleft') to return a stacked result. In addition, it contains a dictionary ('_operators') that relates operators to their respective functions. The code in code sample 2 is a portion of the earlier function, simply recreating the part where 'cright' is defined and eventually returned along with its operation. It does not include the operator mapping part nor the return statement, indicating it could be a fragment of a larger implementation.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace, layout, and the inclusion of additional comments and components in code sample 1.\"}"

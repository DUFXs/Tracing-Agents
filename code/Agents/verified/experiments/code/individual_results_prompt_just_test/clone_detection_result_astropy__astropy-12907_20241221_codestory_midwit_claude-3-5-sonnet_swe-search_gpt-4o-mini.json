    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 performs operations related to a modeling library, specifically handling the cases where inputs `left` and `right` are either instances of `Model` or `CompoundModel`, applying appropriate transformations and returning a combined output using NumPy's `hstack` function. It also initializes `cleft` and `cright` based on the conditions encountered. The code in code sample 2 appears to be an incomplete snippet from the same function, handling the initialization of `cright` based on similar conditions as in code sample 1 and returning the results. However, it lacks the complete context and preceding logic relevant to both `cleft` and `cright` initializations.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 contains a complete set of logic including multiple condition checks and result handling, while code sample 2 consists of a smaller portion that does not present any of the branching or initialization logic from the first sample.\"}"

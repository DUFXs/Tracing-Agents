    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method '__str__' that provides a string representation of the object's model name and class. It also includes a method 'get_inlines' that specifies inline classes based on the request and model instance, and a method 'get_inline_instances' which initializes a list of inline instances based on the inlines specified. The code sample 2 has a similar structure with methods like 'get_inlines' and 'get_inline_instances' but includes a different 'get_ordering' method and lacks the '__str__' method. The 'get_inlines' method in code sample 2 has a simplified docstring and the 'get_ordering' method alters the functionality slightly. Thus, sample 2 is syntactically similar but has additional functionality. Overall, they have similar components but differ in logic and structure.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they exhibit syntactical differences and additional methods in code sample 2 that alter their functionality and structure.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method that overrides the default behavior for attribute access in a class by attempting to retrieve an attribute normally with fallback mechanisms for frame and transformed coordinates. It uses a try-except block to catch an AttributeError and checks various conditions to return the appropriate value or raise the original exception. The method also includes logic for setting attributes in a way that makes them immutable, using a custom __setattr__ method. In contrast, code sample 2 builds upon this by adding a specific return statement that directly calls self.__getattribute__ in case the initial attribute retrieval fails, maintaining immutability with the __setattr__ method. The two samples contain overlapping functionality but differ in what they execute immediately after a certain condition.\",\"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have different statements and logic flow, specifically in how they handle the attribute access and error handling.\"}"

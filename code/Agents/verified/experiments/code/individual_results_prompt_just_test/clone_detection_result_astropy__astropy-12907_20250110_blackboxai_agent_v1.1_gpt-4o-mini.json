    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 implements the functionality of processing two models (left and right) to compute their separability. It checks the type of the models, distinguishing between regular models and compound models, and handles them accordingly to form coordinate matrices that stack results from both models. The code is focused on ensuring that the output accommodates the shapes of the input models to achieve a final output. The code in code sample 2, on the other hand, appears to be a continuation of the logic for processing the right model and includes returning the stacked coordinate matrices. It does not provide complete context but reflects the latter part of a similar operation as in the first sample.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share similar logic and structure but have differences such as missing lines and are not fully identical with respect to the entire context of the function.\"}"

The first code sample includes a call to `complex_filter(limit_choices_to).distinct()`, while the second code sample introduces additional logic related to `Exists`, `OuterRef`, and `pk`, altering the implementation of how limit choices are applied to the form field's queryset. The primary structure and purpose remain consistent, indicating they are related while not being identical.\"}"

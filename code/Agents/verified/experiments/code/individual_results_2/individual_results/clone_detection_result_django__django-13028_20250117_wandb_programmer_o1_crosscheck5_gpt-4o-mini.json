The first sample includes checks for an attribute '_meta' and a loop to call 'check_filterable' on a list of expressions, while the second sample uses a different method of checking if the expression has a 'resolve_expression' and directly evaluates the 'filterable' attribute. The overall logic and flow of the code have diverged, placing them outside the clone classifications.\"}"

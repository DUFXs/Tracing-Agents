Sample 1 contains a method that retrieves the window extent given a renderer, while Sample 2 shows a callable that seems to modify or set properties for an axes object and retrieves the window extent differently. Their internal logic and purpose are distinct, making them syntactically and functionally dissimilar.\"}"

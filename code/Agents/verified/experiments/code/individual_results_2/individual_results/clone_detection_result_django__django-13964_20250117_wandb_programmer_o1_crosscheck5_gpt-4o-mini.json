Specifically, while both samples include similar lines of code regarding the handling of related objects and their primary keys, there are notable differences: the second sample uses 'field.empty_values' whereas the first sample explicitly checks for 'None' and an empty string. Additionally, the second sample omits parts of the comments and does not include some lines from the first sample, indicating some modifications.\"}"

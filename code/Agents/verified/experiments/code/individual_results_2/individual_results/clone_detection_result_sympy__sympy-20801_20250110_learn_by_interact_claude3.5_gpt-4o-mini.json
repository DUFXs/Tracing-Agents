Code sample 1 is focused on testing specific behaviors of the `S` function from the `sympy` library, providing print statements for comparisons of symbolic representations. Code sample 2, on the other hand, deals with the implementation of comparison operators in the `sympy` library, managing the behavior when comparing different types. Therefore, they are not similar enough to be classified under any of the clone types.\"}"

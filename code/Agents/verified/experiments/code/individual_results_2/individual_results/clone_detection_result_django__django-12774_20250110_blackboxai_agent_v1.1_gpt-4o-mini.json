The first code sample is a Git patch indicating changes to a .gitignore file, listing directories and files to ignore. The second sample is a Python code snippet that is part of a model query in the Django framework, which contains assertions, list comprehensions, and conditional statements. There is no syntactical or functional similarity between the two samples, making them entirely distinct.\"}"

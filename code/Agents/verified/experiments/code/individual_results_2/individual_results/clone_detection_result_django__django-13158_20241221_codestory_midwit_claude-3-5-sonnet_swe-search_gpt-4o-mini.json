The first code sample is defining a method 'none' that returns an empty QuerySet with specific handling for combinators, while the second code sample, which involves method implementations like 'set_empty' and 'is_empty', is dealing with handling combined queries in a different context. There is no significant overlap in structure or functionality that would classify them as any type of clone.\"}"

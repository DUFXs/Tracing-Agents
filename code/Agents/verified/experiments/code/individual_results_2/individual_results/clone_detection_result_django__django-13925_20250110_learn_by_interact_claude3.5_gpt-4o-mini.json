While both samples check for the inherited primary key from parent models, the second sample introduces additional logic involving the use of `isinstance(cls._meta.pk, OneToOneField) and cls._meta.pk.remote_field.parent_link`, which are not present in the first sample. This indicates that although they have a similar structure, the functionality is not identical due to these modifications.\"}"

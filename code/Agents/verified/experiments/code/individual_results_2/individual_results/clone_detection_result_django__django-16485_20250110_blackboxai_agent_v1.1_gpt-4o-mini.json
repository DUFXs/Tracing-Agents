Code sample 1 pertains to editing a .gitignore file with paths for files and directories to ignore in version control. In contrast, code sample 2 contains Python code related to error handling and data formatting operations within the context of Django templates. The purpose and syntax of the two snippets are fundamentally different, making them non-clonal.\"}"

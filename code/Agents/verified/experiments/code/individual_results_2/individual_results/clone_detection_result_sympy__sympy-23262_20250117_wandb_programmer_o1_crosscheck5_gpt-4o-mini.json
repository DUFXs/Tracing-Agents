Code sample 1 contains implementations for printing tuples, which include logic for handling single-element and multi-element tuples differently. Code sample 2, on the other hand, is related to handling different iterable types and their string representation, which involves checks for lists and tuples, along with error handling for unhandled types. The two samples do not share a common syntactical structure or functionality that would classify them as clones.\"}"

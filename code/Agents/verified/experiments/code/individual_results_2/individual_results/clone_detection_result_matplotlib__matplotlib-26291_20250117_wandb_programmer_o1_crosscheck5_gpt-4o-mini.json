While both snippets refer to function calls and raise a specific RuntimeError, they do not maintain sufficient syntactical similarity or similar functionality across their entire contexts. In particular, sample 1 includes additional attributes and methods that are absent in sample 2, indicating they serve different purposes despite some overlapping elements.\"}"

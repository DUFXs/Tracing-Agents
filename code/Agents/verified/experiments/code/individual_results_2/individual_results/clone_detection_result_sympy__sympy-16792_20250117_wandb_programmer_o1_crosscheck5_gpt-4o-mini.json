Code sample 1 is a test script demonstrating the use of the `autowrap` function from the SymPy library, while code sample 2 appears to be part of a code generation utility that handles array-like arguments and dimensions. Their functionalities, structures, and statements are significantly different, making them functionally dissimilar.\"}"

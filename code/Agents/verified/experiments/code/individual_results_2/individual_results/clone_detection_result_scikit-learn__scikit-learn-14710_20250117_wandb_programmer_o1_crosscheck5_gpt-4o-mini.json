    "response": "{\"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share similar structures but have different statements and conditions at certain points. Specifically, in sample 1, it checks if the object has a 'classes_' attribute using 'if hasattr(self, 'classes_'):', while sample 2 checks if the object is a classifier using 'if is_classifier(self):'. This change in logic results in a syntactic difference, making them functionally similar but syntactically distinct.\"}"

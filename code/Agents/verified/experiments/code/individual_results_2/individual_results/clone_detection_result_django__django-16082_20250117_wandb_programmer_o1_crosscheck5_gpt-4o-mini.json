Code sample 1 includes a complete definition of connector combinations, along with comments and a greater number of fields being handled, while code sample 2 only includes a portion of the code, focused solely on a few parts of the combinations. Therefore, they do not share enough structural or functional similarity to be considered clones.\"}"

Code sample 1 is a unit test specifically testing the behavior of gamma matrices in the 'reproduce_error.py' file, while code sample 2 appears to be part of a different implementation in 'gamma_matrices.py', dealing with the processing of indices and expressions, which is unrelated to the test cases provided in sample 1.\"}"

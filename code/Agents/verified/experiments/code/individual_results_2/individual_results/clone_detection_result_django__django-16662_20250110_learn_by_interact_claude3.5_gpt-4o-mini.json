For example, the first code sample includes detailed comments and a specific import sorting mechanism through list comprehensions, while the second sample simplifies that logic and uses a different approach to sorting imports. Additionally, while they share the core functionality of handling imports and constructing the strings, the structure and implementation details differ.\"}"

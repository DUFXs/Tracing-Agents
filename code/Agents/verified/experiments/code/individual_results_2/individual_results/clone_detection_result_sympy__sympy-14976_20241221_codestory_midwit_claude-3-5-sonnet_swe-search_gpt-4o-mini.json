The first sample is focused on creating a symbolic equation, generating a function from it, and performing numerical computations. The second sample provides implementations for printing rational numbers and upper gamma functions in a specific format, which does not relate to the operations described in the first sample. Hence, there is no syntactical or functional similarity between the two.\"}"

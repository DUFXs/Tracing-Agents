Sample 1 implements a determinant computation using Bareiss's method and contains specific error handling. Sample 2 includes imports and another class definition, with only a mention of a simplified version of the Bareiss function but lacks the complete context and structure of the first sample. The differences in the methods, intended functionality, and the presence of additional classes make them dissimilar.\"}"

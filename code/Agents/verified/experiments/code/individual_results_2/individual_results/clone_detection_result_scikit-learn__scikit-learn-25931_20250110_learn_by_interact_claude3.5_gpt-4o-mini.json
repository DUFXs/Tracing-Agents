Sample 1 is a standalone script that uses the IsolationForest class for different test cases related to anomaly detection, while Sample 2 is a snippet from the implementation of the IsolationForest algorithm itself, dealing with internal methods and class attributes. There is no syntactical similarity or functional equivalence between them.\"}"

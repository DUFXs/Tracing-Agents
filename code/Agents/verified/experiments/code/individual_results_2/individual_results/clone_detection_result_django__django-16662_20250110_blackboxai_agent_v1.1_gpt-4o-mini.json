For instance, Code Sample 2 uses a lambda function for the key in the `sorted` function, while Code Sample 1 uses a separate function, 'import_sort_key'. Additionally, the comments have different phrasing, and there are minor differences in whitespace. Despite these changes, the essential logic of sorting imports and constructing the output remains consistent between the two samples.\"}"

The first sample is a longer section dealing with various conditions for evaluating products in the context of symbolic mathematics, while the second sample contains only a few lines related to handling certain expressions. There are also notable differences in functionality, focus, and structure, indicating that while they may be from the same file, they are not clones.\"}"

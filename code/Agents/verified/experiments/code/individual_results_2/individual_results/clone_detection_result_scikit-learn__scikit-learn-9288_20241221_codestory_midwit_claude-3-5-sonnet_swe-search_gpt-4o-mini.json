Code sample 1 focuses on computing cluster centers and handling empty clusters in a k-means algorithm, while code sample 2 deals with initializing seeds, running the k-means algorithm multiple times, and managing parallelization. They share the context of k-means clustering but do not exhibit syntactical similarity or functional equivalence.\"}"

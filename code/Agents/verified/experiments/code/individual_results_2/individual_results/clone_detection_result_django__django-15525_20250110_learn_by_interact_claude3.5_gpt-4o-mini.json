Code sample 1 is a complete Django script that sets up models, creates test data, and performs serialization and deserialization operations. In contrast, Code sample 2 is an excerpt from Django's internal serializer code, dealing with model instances and their natural keys. There is no significant syntactic similarity or functional equivalence between the two samples.\"}"

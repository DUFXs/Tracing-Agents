Code sample 1 focuses on manipulating strings and processing lines from a docstring, while code sample 2 involves imports and relates to application-level operations such as examining functions and their documentation. There are no functional similarities or syntactical resemblance between the two samples, thus they do not qualify as clones.\"}"

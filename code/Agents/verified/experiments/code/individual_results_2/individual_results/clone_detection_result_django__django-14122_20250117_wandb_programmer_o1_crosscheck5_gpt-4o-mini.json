The first sample is focused on managing an ORDER BY clause, including handling expressions for sorting with randomization and conditionally altering the order based on the query context. The second sample, on the other hand, deals with collecting columns for a GROUP BY clause and does not exhibit significant syntactic similarity or functional equivalence with the first sample.\"}"

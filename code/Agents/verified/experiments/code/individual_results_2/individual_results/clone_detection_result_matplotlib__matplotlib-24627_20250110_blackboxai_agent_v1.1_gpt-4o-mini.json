The first code sample deals with a patch related to .gitignore, which focuses on file editing and configuration, while the second code sample involves Python code related to a class or function within matplotlib, highlighting variable assignments and graphical parameters. They serve different purposes and contexts, thus cannot be classified as clones.\"}"

Code sample 1 modifies `col.info.format` based on the `self.data.formats`, whereas code sample 2 modifies `self.data.cols` and additionally calls methods like `_set_fill_values` and `_set_col_formats`, which are not present in code sample 1. This indicates added or modified statements while maintaining some common logic.\"}"

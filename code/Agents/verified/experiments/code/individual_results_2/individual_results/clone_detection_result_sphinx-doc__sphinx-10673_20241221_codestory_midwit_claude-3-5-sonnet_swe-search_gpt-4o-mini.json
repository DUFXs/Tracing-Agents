Sample 1 creates a test environment for generating documentation using Sphinx, while Sample 2 involves parsing document content for a specific directive function, which focuses on handling document entries and excluding certain documents. The syntactical structure and the functionalities diverge considerably, indicating they are not clones.\"}"

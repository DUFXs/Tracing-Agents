Sample 1 defines a test function for calculating distances between geometric points and includes multiple test cases. In contrast, Sample 2 contains a portion of a distance calculation method from a class definition, focusing on how the distance between points is computed based on their respective coordinates. The structure, functionality, and intent of the two pieces of code are distinct.\"}"

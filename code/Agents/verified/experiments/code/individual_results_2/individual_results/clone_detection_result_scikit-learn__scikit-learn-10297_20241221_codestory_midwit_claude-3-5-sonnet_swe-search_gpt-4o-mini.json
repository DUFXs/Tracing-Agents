The first sample is a complete script that generates data, fits a Ridge classifier model, and prints the shape of the cross-validation values. The second sample is part of a documentation and implementation of a class method in a library, detailing parameter options and the attributes of the class, without any functional code that corresponds to the execution in the first sample. They are fundamentally different in terms of both function and context.\"}"

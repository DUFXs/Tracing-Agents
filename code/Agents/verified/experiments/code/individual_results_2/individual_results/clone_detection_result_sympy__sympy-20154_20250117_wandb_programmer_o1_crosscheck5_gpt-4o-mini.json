Code sample 1 contains a complete function definition for 'partitions' and includes detailed comments and logic that define its operation, while code sample 2 appears to be missing the function's implementation and is incomplete, lacking context and essential elements that would make it functionally related. Therefore, they cannot be classified as clones.\"}"

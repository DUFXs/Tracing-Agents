Code sample 1 focuses on testing the behavior and expected outputs of `Columns` and `IndexColumns`, while code sample 2 implements the `__str__` method for string representation of the columns and possibly their suffixes. The logic and structure in both samples are significantly different, making them functionally distinct.\"}"

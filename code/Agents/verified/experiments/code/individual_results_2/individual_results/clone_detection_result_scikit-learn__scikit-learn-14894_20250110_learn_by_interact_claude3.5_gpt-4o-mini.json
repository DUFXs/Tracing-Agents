The first sample defines a training setup for a Support Vector Regression model using specific input data, while the second sample appears to be part of the internal implementation of the sklearn library, dealing with support vectors in relation to the model's prediction functionality. They are not syntactically similar, nor do they share identical functionality.\"}"

For instance, in the first sample, the output of the 'solve_univariate_inequality' call is returned directly, while in the second sample, it's stored in 'xset' before being returned. Additionally, there are minor changes in comments and the import path of 'ConditionSet', which indicate modifications. This alteration signifies that the two samples, although conceptually similar, are not identical due to added or modified statements.\"}"

Code sample 1 handles tuples and strings differently, implementing distinct logic for single-element tuples and returning strings directly. In contrast, code sample 2 focuses on handling lists and contains a different method for traversing and handling iterables. The changes in functionality and flow, coupled with variable assignment and structural differences, indicate that they are functionally dissimilar.\"}"

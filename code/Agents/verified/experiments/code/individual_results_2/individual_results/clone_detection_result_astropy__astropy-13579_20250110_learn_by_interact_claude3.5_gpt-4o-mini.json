For instance, the second sample has additional logic pertaining to 'sliced_out_world_coords' which alters the flow slightly compared to the first sample. However, they both operate on 'world_arrays' and have similar operations involving 'world_arrays_new', showing they are syntactically similar with added or modified statements.\"}"

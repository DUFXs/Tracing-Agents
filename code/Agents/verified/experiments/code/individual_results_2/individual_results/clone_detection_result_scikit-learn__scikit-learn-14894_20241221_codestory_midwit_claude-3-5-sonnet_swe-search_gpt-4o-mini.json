The first sample is a complete implementation of an SVR model with training data and testing, while the second sample appears to be a snippet from an SVM library file related to coefficient handling and prediction. The structure, functionality, and overall goals of the two code snippets are distinct, making them syntactically and functionally dissimilar.\"}"

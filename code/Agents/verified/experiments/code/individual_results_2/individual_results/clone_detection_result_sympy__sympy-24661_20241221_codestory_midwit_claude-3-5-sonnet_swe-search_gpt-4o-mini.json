Code sample 1 focuses on testing and printing relational expressions using the `parse_expr` function, while code sample 2 appears to involve abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation related to parsing and handling relational operations. The syntactic structure and functional intent of both code samples are distinct.\"}"

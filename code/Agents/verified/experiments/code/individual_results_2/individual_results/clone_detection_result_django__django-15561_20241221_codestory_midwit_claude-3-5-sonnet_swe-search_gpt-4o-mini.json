Sample 1 contains a list of non-database attributes while Sample 2 includes actual code operations such as looping through `old_field.non_db_attrs` and `new_field.non_db_attrs`, modifying `old_kwargs` and `new_kwargs`, and performing a comparison. The presence of different logical constructs and operations means they are not syntactically or functionally similar.\"}"

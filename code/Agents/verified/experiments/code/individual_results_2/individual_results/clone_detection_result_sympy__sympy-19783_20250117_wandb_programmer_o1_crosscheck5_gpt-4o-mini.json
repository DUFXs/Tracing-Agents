The first code sample correctly returns an expression from the multiplication operation, while the second code sample attempts to return a multiplication operation involving the `Mul` class instead of directly falling back to `Expr.__mul__`. There are also differences in the organization and inclusion of some lines, indicating they are not functionally equivalent.\"}"

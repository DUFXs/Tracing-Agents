The first sample implements a detailed complement function for sets, including checks for different set types and handling of known and unknown elements. The second sample, on the other hand, contains a different approach using a `sift` utility for filtering elements, focusing on a specific aspect of set membership. The logic and purpose of these two code snippets are not equivalent.\"}"

Code sample 1 demonstrates the usage of the sympy parser to evaluate expressions, while code sample 2 outlines a method for comparing nodes within an abstract syntax tree (AST) and constructing new AST nodes based on relational operators. The context, structure, and purpose of the two code samples differ significantly, making them syntactically dissimilar and functionally unrelated.\"}"

Sample 1 focuses on the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function, primarily dealing with reporting outcomes related to tests, while Sample 2 includes the `pytest_runtest_setup` function and additional logic before entering the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function. They have different flows, structures, and purpose within the pytest framework.\"}"

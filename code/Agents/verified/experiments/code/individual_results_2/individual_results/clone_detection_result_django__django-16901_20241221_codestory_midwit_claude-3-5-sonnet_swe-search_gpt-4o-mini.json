For example, in sample 2, there is an additional conditional statement checking the length of self.children to modify rhs_sum using the Mod function, which is not present in sample 1. Additionally, the use of `Mod` in place of the modulo operator in the rhs assignment indicates a syntactical alteration.\"}"

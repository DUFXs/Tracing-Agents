The first sample uses a list of non-database attributes and processes them in a loop, while the second sample accesses attribute lists from `old_field` and `new_field`, indicating they reference different data structures. Furthermore, there are additional return statements and different operations in the two samples, making them syntactically dissimilar.\"}"

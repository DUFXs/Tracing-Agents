The first sample is a patch edit for a '.gitignore' file, which consists of file paths that the version control system should ignore. The second sample contains Python code related to query construction in a Django model, involving various operations on filter expressions and joins. There is no syntactic or functional equivalence between the two code samples.\"}"

Code sample 1 focuses on deduplicating locations and assigning unique pairs to `self.locations` and `self.uuids`, while code sample 2 is an iterator that yields messages along with their positions and UUIDs. The logic and the purpose of the code differ significantly, making them syntactically dissimilar and functionally distinct.\"}"

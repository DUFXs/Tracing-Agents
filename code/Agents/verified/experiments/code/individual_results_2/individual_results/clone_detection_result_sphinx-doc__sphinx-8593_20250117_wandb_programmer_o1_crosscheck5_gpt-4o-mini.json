Sample 1 contains a long function `filter_members` with functionality related to filtering members of a class, while Sample 2 consists of a different function `get_module_members` that retrieves members of a module. The functions have different purposes, parameters, and implementations, making them semantically and syntactically dissimilar.\"}"

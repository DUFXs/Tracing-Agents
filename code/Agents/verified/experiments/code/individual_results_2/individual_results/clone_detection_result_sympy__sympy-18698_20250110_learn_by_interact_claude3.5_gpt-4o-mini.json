Code sample 1 focuses on creating test cases for symbolic factorization using the SymPy library, while code sample 2 appears to involve internal implementation details of polynomial manipulation within the SymPy library. They are syntactically and functionally distinct, with no shared code patterns that would classify them as clones.\"}"

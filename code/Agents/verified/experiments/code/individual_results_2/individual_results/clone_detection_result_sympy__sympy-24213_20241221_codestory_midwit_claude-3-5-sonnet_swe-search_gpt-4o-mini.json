The first code sample is a complete script involving quantity dimensions and testing with the SI unit system, while the second code sample is a snippet potentially involved in implementing dimensions but is incomplete and lacks the structure or identifiers present in the first. They do not exhibit any structural similarity or functional equivalence.\"}"

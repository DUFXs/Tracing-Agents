While both snippets involve a `ModelFormMetaclass` and utilize a pattern for obtaining `formfield_callback`, they diverge entirely in their internal logic. The second sample introduces conditions regarding the base class and other attributes not present in the first sample, indicating they are functionally dissimilar and serve different purposes within the implementation.\"}"

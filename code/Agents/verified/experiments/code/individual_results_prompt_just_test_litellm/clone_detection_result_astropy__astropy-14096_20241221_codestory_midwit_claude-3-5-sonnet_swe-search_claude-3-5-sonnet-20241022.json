While they are related (both deal with attribute access), they serve different purposes: sample 1 handles the initial attribute lookup and custom property definition, while sample 2 handles frame transformations and attribute setting. They have different control flow, different conditions, and different functionality. Sample 1 focuses on checking class dictionaries and handling custom properties, while sample 2 deals with frame transformations and attribute mutation prevention. The code structures and purposes are fundamentally different.\"\n}"

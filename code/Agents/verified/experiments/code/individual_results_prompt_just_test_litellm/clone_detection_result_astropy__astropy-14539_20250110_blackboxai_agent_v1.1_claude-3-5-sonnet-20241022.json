    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code sample 1 contains two parts: a .gitignore file update that adds 'results' and '.aider/' to ignored files, and a Python code snippet from astropy/io/fits/diff.py that handles array comparison logic. The Python code checks for floating-point arrays and performs a comparison using where_not_allclose function, followed by handling P and Q format arrays. Code sample 2 contains only the Python code part from astropy/io/fits/diff.py, with identical array comparison logic.\", \n\"is_clone\": false, \n\"classification\": \"N/A\", \n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not true clones because sample 1 contains both .gitignore file changes and Python code, while sample 2 contains only the Python code portion. While the Python code portions are identical, the presence of additional, unrelated content in sample 1 (.gitignore changes) means these cannot be considered clones of each other. For them to be clones, they would need to contain the same type of content (either both .gitignore changes or both Python code).\"}"

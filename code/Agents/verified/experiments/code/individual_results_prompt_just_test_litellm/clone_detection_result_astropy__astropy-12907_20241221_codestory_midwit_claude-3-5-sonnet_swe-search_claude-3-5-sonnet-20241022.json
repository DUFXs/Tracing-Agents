It includes logic for both left and right sides, and includes a test file. The code in code sample 2 is actually a subset of code sample 1, specifically the part that handles the right-side matrix assignment and the final return statement.\",\n    \"is_clone\": false,\n    \"classification\": \"N/A\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 2 is actually just a subset of code sample 1. While they share some identical lines, code sample 1 contains significantly more functionality, including the handling of left-side matrices and compound models. For them to be considered clones, they would need to be separate but similar implementations of the same functionality, rather than one being a subset of the other. This appears to be part of a patch where code sample 2 shows the unchanged portion of the file while code sample 1 shows both changed and unchanged portions.\"\n}"

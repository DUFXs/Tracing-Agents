(2) A test file that creates and tests compound models using the separability_matrix function. Code sample 2 contains only the matrix operation part that's also present in sample 1, specifically the code that handles the right coordinate matrix and returns the horizontal stack of left and right matrices.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-1\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because code sample 2 is an exact subset of code sample 1, with identical code lines for handling the right coordinate matrix and returning the stacked result. The only difference is that sample 1 contains additional code (the operators dictionary and test file) that's not present in sample 2. The overlapping portions are identical in terms of syntax, whitespace, and logic, making this a type-1 clone relationship for the shared code segment.\"\n}"

It includes a detailed implementation that checks for shape mismatches, handles floating-point comparisons using np.allclose, and non-floating point comparisons using np.array_equal.

Code sample 2 appears to be a refactored or alternative version that might do something similar, but we can't determine the full equivalence since it's incomplete. The samples share some context but don't have enough matching implementation to be considered clones of any type.\"\n}"

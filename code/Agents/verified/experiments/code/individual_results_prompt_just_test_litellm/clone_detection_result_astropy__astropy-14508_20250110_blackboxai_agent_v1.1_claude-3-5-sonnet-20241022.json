    "response": "{\n\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is a function that formats a floating-point number to ensure it has a decimal point. It first tries to use str() for a human-friendly representation, and if the result is not too long (\u226420 characters) and contains either a decimal point or scientific notation, it uses that representation (normalizing 'e' to 'E'). Otherwise, it falls back to a high-precision representation with 16 significant digits and ensures there's a decimal point. The code in code sample 2 is also a function that formats a floating-point number, but its primary goal is to ensure the output is at most 20 characters long. It handles this by truncating either decimal places or the significand in scientific notation as needed.\",\n\"is_clone\": true,\n\"classification\": \"type-3\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they have the same basic purpose (formatting floating-point numbers) and share some similar operations (like converting 'e' to 'E'), but they have different implementations and slightly different goals. Sample 1 focuses on ensuring decimal point representation and human readability, while Sample 2 focuses on ensuring a maximum length of 20 characters. They have similar structure but with modified statements and different logic paths, which is characteristic of type-3 clones. They're not type-4 clones because they still maintain some syntactic similarity, and they're not type-1 or type-2 because they have substantial differences in their implementation.\"\n}"

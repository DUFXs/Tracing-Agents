The second part is a complete test file (reproduce_issue.py) that sets up Django models and tests FilteredRelation functionality. Code sample 2 shows a different section of django/db/models/sql/query.py that deals with query construction and join optimization, specifically handling trimming of joins and managing aliases.\",\n\"is_clone\": false,\n\"classification\": \"N/A\",\n\"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they represent different functionalities and sections of code. While they both deal with Django's query handling, they serve different purposes: Sample 1 shows query cloning and basic filter operations, while Sample 2 focuses on join optimization and alias management. The overlapping lines (like add_filter and clear_ordering) are just small parts of otherwise different code blocks. The code structure, purpose, and implementation details are substantially different, and they cannot be considered clones of any type. Additionally, Sample 1 includes a complete test file that's entirely different from the query handling code in Sample 2.\"\n}"

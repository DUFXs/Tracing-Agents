Sample 1 contains all the code from sample 2 plus additional logic for handling the left side of the computation and compound models. While they share some identical lines, this is because sample 2 is literally the end portion of sample 1, not because they are clones. For code segments to be considered clones, they should be separate, independent pieces of code that serve similar purposes, not just one being a subset of the other.\"\n}"

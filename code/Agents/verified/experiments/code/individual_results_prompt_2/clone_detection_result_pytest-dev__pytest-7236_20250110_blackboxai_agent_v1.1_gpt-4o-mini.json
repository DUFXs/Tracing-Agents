    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 manages the behavior of tearDown in test cases when running with a debugger (pdb). It checks if the pdb option is enabled and if any tests are skipped, modifying the tearDown method accordingly. The comments provide context about why certain actions are taken, especially concerning debugging situations. On the other hand, code sample 2 involves setup and management of test fixtures, specifically handling skipped tests and possibly modifying the teardown process based on whether the test setup is needed. This code has additional functionality for skipping tests and adds various decorators and fixture logic.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they implement different functionalities: the first is focused on managing the tearDown behavior in tests while debugging, and the second has more extensive logic for handling test fixtures and skipping, with no syntactical or functional similarity that would categorize them as clones.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function named `check_sqlite_version()` that checks if the SQLite version is less than 3.9.0 and raises an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception if it is, including the found version in the error message. It then calls this function to perform the check. The code in code sample 2 performs the same operations, but the syntax for raising the `ImproperlyConfigured` exception is formatted differently, with the error message split across multiple lines. However, the logic and functionality remain identical.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-2\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are functionally identical except for differences in whitespace, layout, and literal formatting.\"}"

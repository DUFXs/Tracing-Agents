    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines methods for managing non-form errors and validation within a Django formset in a way that indicates it performs error handling and form validation. It includes logic to clean the form and manage errors if they occur during validation. The second code sample contains a similar structure where it also deals with non-form errors and has the same method for cleaning the form, but it presents the code slightly differently, focusing on the assignment of the non-form errors. Both code samples share the same functionality related to handling errors and form validation, but they also differ in layout and some specific coding constructs.\",\"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but differ in the arrangement and possibly the presence of statements.\"}"

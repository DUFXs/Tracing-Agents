This patch indicates which lines are being added or changed. The code section included highlights how connection parameters for a PostgreSQL database are being modified, with additional arguments like the host and port being added to the 'args' list. The code in code sample 2, on the other hand, only shows the new state of the code without any surrounding context or git patch information. It highlights the same segment where connection parameters are being processed but omits the git patch metadata found in the first sample.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in terms of code content, only differing in the additional context provided in code sample 1 related to the git patch/versioning information.\"}"

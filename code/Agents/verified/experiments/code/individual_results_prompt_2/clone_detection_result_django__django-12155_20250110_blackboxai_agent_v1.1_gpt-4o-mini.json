    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is implementing a function to parse and format a docstring, where it calculates indentation based on the content of the docstring and returns a trimmed version. It processes lines of the docstring by converting tabs to spaces, handling single line cases, and finalizing the output as a clean string. The code in code sample 2 seems to be part of a larger module which includes various imports and functions related to parsing and processing docstrings as well, but it is focused on different handling aspects and integrates with Django's utilities. This sample appears to have additional context and functionality for extracting parts of the docstring, but does not directly resemble the first sample in structure or purpose. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes within their respective contexts and have significant differences in implementation, making them functionally dissimilar.\"}"

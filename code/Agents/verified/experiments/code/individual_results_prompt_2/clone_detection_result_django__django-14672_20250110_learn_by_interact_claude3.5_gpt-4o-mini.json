    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines two methods within a class. The first method, `identity`, returns a super call plus a tuple that includes `self.through`, a call to `make_hashable` with `self.through_fields`, and `self.db_constraint`. The second method, `get_related_field`, describes a process for retrieving a specific field in a related object, but its implementation is incomplete. In contrast, code sample 2 only includes the `identity` method, which has a similar implementation but formatted in a different way. The `get_related_field` method is not present in code sample 2, indicating that only part of the functionality is represented there.\",\"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because the `identity` method in both samples is syntactically similar, but code sample 1 contains additional methods that are not present in code sample 2, thus making them functionally different while sharing a core structure.\"}"

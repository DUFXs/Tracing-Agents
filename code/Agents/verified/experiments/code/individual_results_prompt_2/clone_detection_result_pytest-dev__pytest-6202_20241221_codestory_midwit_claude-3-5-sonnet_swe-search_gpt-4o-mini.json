    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 includes an import statement for pytest and defines a test function `test_boo` that takes a parameter `a` and asserts a failure intentionally to demonstrate an error message. This part of the code does not appear in the second sample. The code in code sample 2 appears to be a segment of some function within a class that seems to deal with reversing a list of parts and joining them into a string, along with a method `reportinfo` that includes a comment about caching. The two code samples do not share a common functionality and are different in both purpose and syntax.\" , \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve entirely different purposes: one is for testing and the other for handling part names in a potential reporting function.\"}"

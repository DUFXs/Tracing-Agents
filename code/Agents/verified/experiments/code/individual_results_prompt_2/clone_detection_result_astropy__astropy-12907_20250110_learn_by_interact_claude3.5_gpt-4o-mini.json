The function uses numpy for matrix operations. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 also includes a patch, but it only shows a part of the function that performs similar computations with matrices, specifically the creation of the right coordinate matrix and returning the combined output, but with no accompanying context or comments as seen in sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for trivial differences like whitespace and layout.\"}"

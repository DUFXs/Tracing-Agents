    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a test function that uses the `unittest.mock.patch` decorator to mock the behavior of `os.getcwd`, setting it to return a NumPy array. The test is set up to run with pytest if called as a script. The second part shows code that handles patchings for mock modules in a Pytest compatibility file, specifically checking if any default sentinels should be used for the mock patching. In contrast, code sample 2 seems to retrieve patchings from a function and checks for their existence. It also defines a variable for mock sentinels, but the context and operations are different and more focused on managing patchings. Overall, they serve different purposes within the pytest or mocking environment and are not structurally similar or equivalent in functionality.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they are significantly different in terms of functionality, context, and structure; code sample 1 is focused on a specific test setup, while code sample 2 deals with mock patching management.\"}"

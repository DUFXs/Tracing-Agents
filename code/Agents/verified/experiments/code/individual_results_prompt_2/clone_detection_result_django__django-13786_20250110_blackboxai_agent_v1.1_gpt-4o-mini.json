    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 creates a new options dictionary by copying the existing options and then removes any tracked keys that are not present in the operation's options, before updating the new options with the operation's options. Finally, it returns a list containing a CreateModel instance with the updated options. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 also combines the existing options and the operation's options into a new options dictionary using dictionary unpacking, and it has similar logic for removing keys and returning a CreateModel instance. However, the way the options dictionary is created differs between the two code samples.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but differ in the method of merging dictionaries and using identifiers.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is primarily setting up a series of test cases using a Decision Tree Classifier from the sklearn library, fitting it with the Iris dataset, and then exporting and printing the results of the tree's structure under different conditions. It includes error handling for cases where feature names are either not provided or empty. The majority of the code is concerned with preparing different scenarios to evaluate the behavior of the decision tree classifier. The code in code sample 2 deals with the internal implementation of exporting a tree structure, where it checks if feature names are provided and creates a list accordingly, handling cases for undefined features. It is part of the export process and is syntactically different from the rest of the decision tree testing done in sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve entirely different purposes: code sample 1 is focused on testing the decision tree with various feature input cases, while code sample 2 is an implementation snippet related to how feature names are handled in the decision tree export logic.\"}"

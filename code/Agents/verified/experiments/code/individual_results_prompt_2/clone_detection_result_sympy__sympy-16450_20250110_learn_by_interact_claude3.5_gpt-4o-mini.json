    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is primarily a test script that demonstrates the use of the `posify` function from the SymPy library with different symbolic assumptions using the Symbol class. It creates symbolic variables with various assumptions (finite, integer, positive) and shows the original and modified assumptions after applying `posify`. The code sample 2, however, contains parts of a method that deals with simplifying expressions by substituting symbols with their assumptions and creating new symbols (Dummy) with preserved assumptions, specifically for symbols that are not known to be positive. Thus, Code Sample 1 focuses on testing while Code Sample 2 focuses on internal functionality of the simplification process.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes: one is a test case while the other is a function for symbolic manipulation.\"}"

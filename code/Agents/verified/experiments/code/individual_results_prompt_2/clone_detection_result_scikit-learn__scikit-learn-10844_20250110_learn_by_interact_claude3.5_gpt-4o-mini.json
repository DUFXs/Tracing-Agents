    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 calculates two values, tk and pk, that involve matrix operations and sums related to the data in a contingency matrix. It returns a scaled square root value based on these calculations, handling division by zero with a conditional statement. The `entropy` function calculates the entropy of cluster labels using a logarithmic formula. In code sample 2, the first few lines introduce a check for clustering results, followed by the same calculations for tk, pk, and qk, eventually returning the same computed square root value. The `entropy` function appears similar, though it may differ in the presence of certain comments. However, crucially, the first code sample omits the clustering check at the beginning. Therefore, while some parts are common, there are additional statements in the second sample that modify its functionality. Hence, they have the same underlying logic but different statements included.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but include added and modified statements in the second sample, thus they are functionally distinct despite having similar core functionalities.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a class `String` (derived from `Atom`) that represents a string in the SymPy library. It includes comments, class attributes, and methods for returning the object's text and functionality. The second code sample also deals with SymPy, defining a class `String` in a similar context but includes additional imports and functionalities related to string objects in a more complex manner with methods for handling its behavior, including a property and a method for returning a function. Both samples also define the `QuotedString` class, which is intended to represent strings within quotes. However, they focus on slightly different aspects of the same project and contain distinct implementations.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they differ in their structure, logic, and functionality, representing different implementations and classes within the SymPy library. They are not simply variations or modifications of each other but reflect separate parts of related but distinct functionalities.\"}"

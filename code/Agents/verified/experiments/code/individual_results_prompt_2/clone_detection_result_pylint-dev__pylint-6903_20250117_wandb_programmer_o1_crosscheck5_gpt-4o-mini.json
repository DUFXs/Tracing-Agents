    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is defining a function `_cpu_count()` that counts the number of CPUs available, ensuring at least one CPU is returned, and it includes handling for CPU shares. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 is reading CPU shares from a file and calculating available CPU based on that, with similar logic for ensuring at least one CPU is available. Both samples deal with CPU count but in different contexts and implementations.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they are implemented differently and operate in different contexts, one is focused on the return of CPU count from a function while the other is reading values and calculating from a file.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains methods for manipulating migration operations in Django, specifically related to 'AddField', 'AlterField', and 'RemoveField'. It includes a return statement for altering fields and a definition for reducing operations based on certain conditions. The code sample also includes a main function to test whether migrations optimize correctly. In contrast, code sample 2 is a fragment focused on an implementation of the 'reduce' method, checking if the operation is of type 'AlterField' or 'RemoveField' and then returning the operation based on conditions. It does not include any testing or import statements visible in code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share similar structured logic focusing on the handling of migration operations, but code sample 1 has added logic for testing and a full function definition, whereas code sample 2 is a partial implementation that alters certain conditions.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a callable class that manages rendering on a matplotlib axis, ensuring that a suitable renderer is available for drawing operations. It includes mechanisms to fetch or create a renderer as well as handling window extent and transformations. The second code sample is a snippet that raises an error if a draw method is called under improper conditions, followed by a similar callable method that attempts to get a renderer and manages axes. Essentially, both samples share similar functionalities related to renderers in the context of matplotlib, but they are not identical in structure.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they address rendering in matplotlib differently. The first sample is more comprehensive and has additional logic related to obtaining a renderer, while the second sample has a different control flow with a raise statement, suggesting they do not mirror each other closely enough to be considered clones.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains a patch that includes added context such as the file change details, while the code in code sample 2 presents a similar excerpt from a Python file without the context of the patch. Both samples share the same structure and function, indicating they potentially represent the same code segment. However, code sample 1 includes additional lines that identify a file ('tests/.coverage', 'build/', etc.) being patched, which are not present in code sample 2. The actual lines of code related to class methods ('__hash__' and '__deepcopy__') are identical in both samples, suggesting that functionality is unchanged. Therefore, they are type-1 clones because the content of the methods themselves is identical apart from the patch metadata surrounding it.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace, layout, and comments associated with the patching information.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function that tests complex exponentiation using the SymPy library by attempting to simplify various expressions like cos(x)**I, cos(x)**(2 + 3*I), and cos(x)**2, while handling exceptions during simplification. The code in code sample 2 appears to be a fragment from the simplification logic within the SymPy library, specifically addressing conditions under which certain transformations for expressions should be skipped based on the nature of the exponent. Both code snippets are related to the SymPy library but are clearly performing different roles.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they belong to different contexts: one is for testing complex powers in a user-defined function, while the other is part of the simplification process in the library. They are not syntactically similar nor functionally equivalent in their objectives.\"}"

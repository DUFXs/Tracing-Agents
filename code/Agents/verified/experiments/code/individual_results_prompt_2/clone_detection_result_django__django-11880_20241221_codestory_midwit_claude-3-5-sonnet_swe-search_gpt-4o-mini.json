    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a Django form called ProfileForm with a CharField named 'name'. It creates two instances of this form and modifies the error message for 'name' in one of the instances before printing the error messages from both forms. This illustrates how error messages for a field in a Django form are shared between instances due to shallow copying. The code sample 2 appears to be part of a method responsible for copying instances of a field in a Django form, where it creates a deep copy of the widget and copies the error messages and validators, returning a new result. This functionality is related to the handling of form data and validation in Django forms, but it is focused on the copying mechanism rather than form instantiation and messaging. Overall, while both code samples are related to Django forms and error handling, they serve different purposes and are not structurally or logically similar enough to be considered clones.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes related to Django form handling; the first sample deals with form instantiation and error message management, while the second focuses on the internal copying mechanism of form fields.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 and code sample 2 both handle a scenario where a field is being checked for existence and validity in a Django model context. Sample 1 includes a check for a special case where `isnull` is a valid lookup for ordering, continuing the loop if certain conditions are met. Sample 2 also checks if a field is `None` or whether the transform and lookup for the field are both `None`, indicating potential errors in the ordering lookup. Both code snippets appear to be part of a validation or error handling process, but they differ in the specific condition checks being employed.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but contain modified statements around what conditions are being checked for the field.\"}"

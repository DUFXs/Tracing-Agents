    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 imports the 'sympy' library and creates a Symbol instance, checking for the presence of its __slots__ attribute and attempting to access its __dict__. It handles the expected AttributeError if the __dict__ does not exist, and then checks the class hierarchy for __slots__. In contrast, code sample 2 contains comments and a definition of __slots__ within a docstring context; it mentions that the class is a mixin to avoid having a __dict__ for instances of subclasses using slots. However, it does not provide any functional operation or symbol creation as seen in code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because the first sample is an executable script that includes logic for creating a symbol and checking its attributes, while the second sample is merely a portion of a class definition containing comments and an empty __slots__ declaration, lacking any executable code.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method `_eval_as_set` that attempts to solve a univariate inequality by first importing a solver function and then executing a try-except block. If the inequality can be solved, it returns the solution. If it fails due to a NotImplementedError, it constructs a ConditionSet for unsolvable equations. The method also includes a property `binary_symbols` but does not specify what it does within the provided code. The code in code sample 2 is very similar in structure and logic to code sample 1. It also defines the method `_eval_as_set` with an identical purpose, but it contains slight variations in variable naming and logging. It handles the NotImplementedError similarly and retrieves a ConditionSet if needed, with a few differences in comments and variable names. Overall, both codes are doing the same thing in function, though with slight differences in comments and how the tries return their values. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-2\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace, some identifier names, and comments.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines methods for equality (__eq__), less than comparison (__lt__), hash (__hash__), and deep copy (__deepcopy__) for a Field class in Django. It ensures that Field instances can be compared, hashed for sets, and deep copied. The equality method checks attributes like creation_counter and model for equality. The less than method provides backwards compatibility by comparing fields based on their creation_counter and model attributes. The code sample also contains a setup script for Django models which is not relevant for the equality and comparison methods. On the other hand, code sample 2 also defines similar methods but incorporates more nuanced logic in the equality and less than methods, such as handling cases where models are not present and providing additional checks for app_label and model_name comparison. The deep copy method implementation remains similar. Therefore, the two samples share similar functional logic but differ significantly in their implementation details. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have added, modified, or removed statements, particularly within the __eq__ and __lt__ methods.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a method that returns a mask based on certain checks regarding the presence of masks in operands. It checks for multiple conditions: if no mask is present, it returns None; if one of the operands has a mask, it deep copies that mask to return it; if both operands have masks, it applies a `handle_mask` operation. The code handles how masks are blended in operations with NDDataRef objects. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 includes similar functionality but with a slightly different structure, focusing on returning a mask depending on whether the operand is None or not. It provides comments about ensuring a copy is made or calculating a resulting mask, but the logic is otherwise intended to accomplish the similar task of managing mask behavior during arithmetic operations. This creates similarity in their functional intent, yet they are not identical lines of code and have additional or altered commented instructions which sets them apart, suggesting they align more with Type-3 clones. Thus, while there are syntactic similarities and overlaps in functionality, the absence of strict identity brings forth the need for a different classification. Therefore, they are clones but with modifications that push them to be Type-3 instead of Type-1 or Type-2.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share similar structures and functionalities regarding mask handling in arithmetic operations but differ in specific implementations and detailed comments.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 and code sample 2 both refer to the same section of code from the Django framework, which includes a return statement followed by some operations to retrieve a queryset based on specific conditions. The only notable difference is that code sample 1 includes extra lines related to changes in the `.gitignore` file, which are not part of the actual code in either sample. Therefore, the relevant code in both samples is identical and only differs in the context of a broader patch. \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in terms of functionality and structure, differing only in the whitespace layout and surrounding context.\"}"

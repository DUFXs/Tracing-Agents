    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a function that fills the area between lines in a stacked plot using Matplotlib. It initializes a color cycle for the plots and sequentially fills between the provided data arrays, while also managing labels and colors. Code sample 2 appears to be a similar function for filling between areas in a stacked plot, but it features the use of itertools to cycle through colors and has some additional management for sticky edges in the plot. This suggests that both samples perform the same high-level task but with some differences in implementation.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but contain added and modified statements, such as the incorporation of itertools in code sample 2, which results in functionally different behavior.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method that adds a field to a model in a SQLite database, including checks for certain conditions (like whether the field is nullable or unique) which dictate if the table needs to be recreated. The code uses detailed comments to describe the constraints of adding fields in SQLite. The code in code sample 2 achieves the same functionality, adding a field to a model with similar checks, but it contains some differences in comments and the order of conditions in the if-statement. However, both snippets essentially perform the same logical task related to database schema management.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar and contain added and modified comments, along with differences in the structure of the if-statement, despite performing the same function.\"}"

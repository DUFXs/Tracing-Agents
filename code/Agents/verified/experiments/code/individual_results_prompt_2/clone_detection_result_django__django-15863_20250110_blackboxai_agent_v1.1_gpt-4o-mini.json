    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 processes a variable `text` to convert it into a `Decimal` object, attempting to handle various formats and exceptions related to non-numeric inputs. It also checks for a character condition using `last_char`. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 also aims to convert `text` to a `Decimal` but uses a different approach by calling `str(text)` instead of `repr(text)` and omits the preliminary check of `isinstance(text, Decimal)`. Both snippets deal with exception handling for invalid conversions. While they share a similar purpose, they diverge in their logic and structure.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they have different methods for handling input and include distinct logical flows. Hence, they can't be classified as any clone type.\"}"

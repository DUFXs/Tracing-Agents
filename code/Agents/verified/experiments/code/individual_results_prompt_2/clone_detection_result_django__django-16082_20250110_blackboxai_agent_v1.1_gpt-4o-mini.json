The second code sample contains a similar patch but does not include the reference to the modified file. Instead, it directly presents the part of the patch related to the operators in the same file.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because the content related to the operators is identical, differing only in the surrounding context included in code sample 1.\"}"

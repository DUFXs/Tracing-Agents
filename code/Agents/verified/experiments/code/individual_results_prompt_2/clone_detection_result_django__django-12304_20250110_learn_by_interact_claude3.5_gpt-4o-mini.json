    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines behavior for handling callable objects in Django templates, checking if they're callable or if they belong to a specific Enum class. It also includes logic to handle cases where the callable cannot be executed and returns keyword arguments. The code in code sample 2, on the other hand, deals with defining a property on an enum class, specifically a property that returns a label from a mapping based on the enum's value. It also includes a special flag to signal that the enum should not be called in templates. Overall, the two code samples are quite different in their functionality and syntax, reflecting different purposes in the Django framework.\" \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes within the Django framework and differ significantly in functionality, structure, and logic.\"}"

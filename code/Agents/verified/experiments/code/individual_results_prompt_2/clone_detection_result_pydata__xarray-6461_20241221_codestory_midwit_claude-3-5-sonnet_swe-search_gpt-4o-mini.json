    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 includes tests to verify that the `xr.where` method from the xarray library preserves attributes when used with scalar and DataArray inputs. It prints results for several test cases related to how conditions and results are formed using xarray DataArrays. The main focus is on validating behavior with the `keep_attrs` parameter. The code in code sample 2 appears to be a segment of a function related to preserving attributes when calling `xr.where`. It checks if the `keep_attrs` flag is None and sets it based on a default, stating how attributes should be handled in the application of the function. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 consists of test cases written in a script format, focusing on using the xarray functionality, while code sample 2 contains logic about handling attributes in the xarray library itself. They have different purposes and structures, thus are not clones.\"}"

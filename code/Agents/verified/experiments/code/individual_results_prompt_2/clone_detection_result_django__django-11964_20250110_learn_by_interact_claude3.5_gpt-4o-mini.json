    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a class called Choices that inherits from enum.Enum which is designed to create enumerated choices in a Django application. It contains a method __str__ that returns the string representation of the choice's value. Additionally, it defines an IntegerChoices class that inherits from both int and Choices and overrides a method to determine how to generate the next value in the enumeration. Code sample 1 also includes code for creating and printing instances of a MyChoice class that utilizes TextChoices, demonstrating how to create enumerations with descriptive labels. In contrast, code sample 2 contains only the definition of the Choices class and its __str__ method, without any additional classes or functionality, highlighting a comment about how its values should be rendered in templates. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 includes additional functionality and classes that are not present in code sample 2, making them syntactically and functionally different.\"}"

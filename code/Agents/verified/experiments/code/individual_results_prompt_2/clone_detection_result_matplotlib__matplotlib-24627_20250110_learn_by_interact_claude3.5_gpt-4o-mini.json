    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a patch for matplotlib, where it is handling visibility for axes and figures associated with artists in a plot, specifically unsetting the axes for all children artists and modifying parameters for visibility of tick marks. The code sample also includes functions for testing the removal of plot lines and clearing axes. In contrast, code sample 2 is also a patch that deals with resetting the internal state of plot children and managing grid state within matplotlib, as well as clearing axes references. It primarily focuses on resetting the axes of child elements without any test functions or outputs.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes, with sample 1 focusing on plot manipulation and testing while sample 2 is about cleaning and resetting states. They do not share syntactic similarity nor are they functionally equivalent.\"}"

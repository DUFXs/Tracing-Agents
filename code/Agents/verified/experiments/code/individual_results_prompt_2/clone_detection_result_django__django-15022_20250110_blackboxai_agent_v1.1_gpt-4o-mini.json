    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 constructs an 'AND' query from search fields and a search term. It starts by creating a list of search lookups based on the provided search fields, splits the search term for processing, and for each split bit, it checks if it is a properly quoted string. The valid bits are then appended to the search bits list. Finally, it creates query conditions using Q objects for filtering inconsistencies, allowing for the possibility of duplicates based on the constructed lookups. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 also processes search fields and terms but introduces term queries for combining multiple filters differently, using `or_queries` for conditions and constructing a query much more compactly using them as parameters to queryset.filter. It also simplifies the management of duplicate searches but with minor changes in the logic.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar with added, modified, or removed statements. While both aim to construct a query based on search terms and fields, code sample 2 modifies the approach slightly by using a different structure for combining queries.\"}"

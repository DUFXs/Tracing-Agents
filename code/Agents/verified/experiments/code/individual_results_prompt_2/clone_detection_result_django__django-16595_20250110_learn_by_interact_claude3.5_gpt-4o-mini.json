    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains logic to handle an 'AlterField' operation within a Django migration framework, specifically returning an operation if it matches certain criteria related to field references. The code also appears to involve operations related to field comparison and an `else` clause for non-matching cases. In contrast, code sample 2 also deals with a method named 'reduce' that handles various field operations, including 'AlterField' and 'RemoveField', indicating a functionality to return or process operations based on their types. However, it has different logic structure and purpose overall.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they demonstrate different logic structures and handle different field operations, which results in syntactic and functional differences.\"}"

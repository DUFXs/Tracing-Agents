    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 sets up a drawing canvas and manages certain events related to user interactions with graphical objects. It includes methods for handling state management of the canvas and the picking of artists. The code also defines a property, 'canvas', which ensures that the canvas is set up only when required. In contrast, code sample 2 contains similar functionality but modifies how the canvas is assigned and handles the events differently, particularly by referencing 'self.canvas.supports_blit' instead of 'self._canvas.supports_blit'. Additionally, the property definitions and some comments are structured differently. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they differ in the handling of the canvas's properties, the definitions of the events, and modifications in layout, which makes them functionally different despite surface similarities.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 includes a file modification patch for two files: a .gitignore file and 'sympy/core/symbol.py'. The .gitignore file specifies files related to pytest, while the 'sympy/core/symbol.py' snippet appears to involve a function that is processing symbols and appending them to a result. The code in code sample 2 only includes a portion of the patch for 'sympy/core/symbol.py' with the same function logic but lacks the .gitignore modification. There are no differing identifiers or literal values in the shared snippet.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because the code in both samples is identical except for the surrounding context provided in the patch, which includes the additional .gitignore data in code sample 1.\"}"

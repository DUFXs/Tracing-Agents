    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines an internal mechanism to manage logging levels within a context in the Pytest framework, including saving and restoring logger levels. It establishes a handler for logging and maintains a dictionary of logger names to their respective levels to enable level restoration on teardown. The finalization process in the _finalize method entails resetting log levels based on previously captured settings. In contrast, code sample 2 also deals with similar logging management but introduces a context manager and modifies the comments and docstrings, mentioning the restoration of log levels changed by certain methods. This sample additionally formats log levels and modifies parts of the internal handling logic, highlighting functional aspects in the comments.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have different comments and additional statements or documentation, leading to slight variations in content while maintaining the same fundamental structure and purpose.\"}"

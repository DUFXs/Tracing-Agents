    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is constructing a list of feature names based on a condition. It checks if the `feature_names` list exists. If it does, it appends 'undefined' to `feature_names_` for tree features that are either undefined or out of bounds, otherwise it appends the corresponding feature name. If `feature_names` does not exist, it defaults to creating a list of strings formatted as 'feature_X'. In contrast, code sample 2 also constructs a list of feature names but uses a single list comprehension for this purpose. It incorporates a conditional within the comprehension to handle the cases for undefined feature indices more concisely, substituting 'None' for indices that are undefined rather than appending 'undefined' as in sample 1. Both codes end with a similar default case for when `feature_names` does not exist, but they differ in how they handle undefined values.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they have similar structures but differ in the way they handle undefined values and implement the list comprehension for constructing feature names.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines two classes, `AddIndex` and `RemoveIndex`, both of which are operations for managing indexes on database models. Each class includes a `reduce` method that checks for specific conditions to determine if the operation can be reduced based on the index and model names. It also initializes attributes related to these indexes. The code in code sample 2 defines a method `migration_name_fragment` which creates a string representation from the model name and index name and also defines the `reduce` method for the `RemoveIndex` class, checking for index removal based on the index name. Both samples appear to be operations related to indexing in migrations but handle different functionalities.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they represent different functionality. Code sample 1 focuses on adding and removing indexes with separate classes, while code sample 2 focuses solely on generating migration names and does not include an `AddIndex` class or the same functionality for index management.\"}"

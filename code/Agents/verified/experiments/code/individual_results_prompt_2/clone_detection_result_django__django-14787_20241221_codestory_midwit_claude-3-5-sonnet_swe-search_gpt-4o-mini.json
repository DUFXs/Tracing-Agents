    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method decorator that wraps a given function, handling exceptions and logging its usage. It uses a partial application of the method.__get__ call to ensure that the 'self' argument is correctly passed. It creates a bound method and updates it with the attributes of the original method before applying the decorators. The result of the method is logged. Meanwhile, code sample 2 is a segment that performs a similar function, focusing on ensuring the correct binding for the method using wraps and partial, and applies the decorators to the bound method. The essence of their functionality is aligned, but there are notable differences such as the use of 'wraps' in sample 2 and the binding method. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but with differences in how the bound method is defined and used, indicating modifications in the statements used.\"}"

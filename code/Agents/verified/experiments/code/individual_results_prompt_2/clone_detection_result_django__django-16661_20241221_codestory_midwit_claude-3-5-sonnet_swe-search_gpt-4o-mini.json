    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks if a given 'prev_field' is either not present or is a relation. If it is a relation, it checks if the 'field' is not among the target fields of the last path info or is a primary key of a OneToOneField. If that condition is satisfied, it adds the 'part' to the 'relation_parts' list. Similarly, it checks if the 'field' has 'path_infos'. On the other hand, code sample 2 appears to break from a loop if there are lookups on nonexistent fields since they would be ignored later. Then it performs a similar check to see if 'prev_field' is not present or is a relation and verifies if the 'field' is not a model's parent or auto field, before adding 'part' to 'relation_parts'. Both samples appear to manipulate a data structure based on the presence of fields and their relationships but target different conditions.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because although they share some structural similarities in checking conditions based on prev_field and field, they operate on distinct conditions and contexts within the code.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 processes content by checking if the first non-empty line is a heading with a domain directive, and based on certain conditions, it inserts a blank line and a prolog into the content. It seems to also handle docinfo by examining if it occurs in the content. The code in code sample 2 similarly checks for a prolog and processes the content by matching lines against a regular expression. It also has sections that manage inserting the prolog after checking for existing content. Both samples are performing similar functions but differ in the specifics of the content they are parsing and the patterns they are utilizing.\",\"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they demonstrate syntactic similarity with modifications: while both handle the insertion of a prolog into the content by checking the conditions of the first non-empty line, code sample 2 introduces additional imports and handles the FIELD_NAME_RE differently compared to the first code sample's structure.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 performs several operations, including checking for convergence in an iterative algorithm, setting parameters, and issuing warnings if the algorithm does not converge. The comments indicate that a final e-step is done to ensure label consistency across different iterations. Meanwhile, the code in code sample 2 also handles parameters and issues warnings when the convergence criteria aren't met. However, it begins with retrieving best parameters before executing the e-step operation, and it includes return statements. The comments about the e-step are similar but placed in different locations within the two samples.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share significant structural and functional similarities, though they contain additional lines, reordered elements, and slightly modified statements.\"}"

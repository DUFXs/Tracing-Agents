    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 demonstrates how modifying one dictionary object can affect all references to it by printing a list of partitions and showing that modifying one entry updates other dictionaries as well. It includes statements to print the partitions and demonstrates the issue with reusing dictionary objects. The code in code sample 2 does not contain any execution code; it appears to be an excerpt from a file defining a generator or function related to ordered partitions, without the context of how it operates or its output.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because the first sample includes executable code with specific outputs and demonstration of behavior, while the second sample consists only of function definitions and lacks any operational context or similarity to the first sample.\"}"

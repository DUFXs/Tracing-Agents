    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 processes a string called 'middle' that has potential trailing punctuation. It first unescapes the HTML entities in 'middle', then removes trailing punctuation and compares the original and stripped strings to detect how many characters were removed. It finally modifies the 'middle' string and prepares a 'trail' string with the removed trailing characters. The second code sample performs similar operations but uses different variable names and slightly alters the order of operations. It also calculates the length of trailing punctuation but uses 'punctuation_count' instead of 'trailing_chars', and constructs the 'trail' string differently. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-2\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are identical in logic and structure but differ in identifier names and the order of statements.\"}"

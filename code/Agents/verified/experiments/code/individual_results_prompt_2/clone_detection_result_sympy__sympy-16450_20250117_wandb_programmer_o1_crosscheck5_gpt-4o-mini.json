    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function 'posify' that transforms expressions to make all symbols positive while maintaining their assumptions, and it builds a dictionary mapping old symbols to their new positive counterparts. It handles both iterable expressions (like lists or tuples) and non-iterable (single expressions). The 'hypersimp' function is mentioned but not fully included. Meanwhile, code sample 2 appears to be a continuation or modification of the same function, specifically focusing on the use of a dictionary comprehension for creating a 'reps' mapping of symbols to their positive versions while considering their existing assumptions. It directly alters the way symbols are transformed into positive versions.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have modifications in terms of the approach for creating the replacements ('reps') for the symbols while making them positive.\"}"

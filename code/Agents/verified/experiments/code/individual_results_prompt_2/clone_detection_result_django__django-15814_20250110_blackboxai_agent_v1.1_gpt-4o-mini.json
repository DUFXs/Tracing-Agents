It then accesses the concrete model of this related model to retrieve its options, also mentioning that it must select both the current model's primary key and related reference fields. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 is performing a similar operation but rearranges some of the logic and accesses the meta options directly from the initial model instead of through a concrete model, adjusting the order of operations slightly. The comments regarding the selection remain essentially the same in both cases. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share a similar syntactic structure but have some statements added, modified, or rearranged, particularly the order of obtaining the meta references.\"}"

Both code samples include identical lines of code without modifications other than possibly being extracted from a larger context.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in the surrounding context provided by the patch information, which does not affect the code itself.\"}"

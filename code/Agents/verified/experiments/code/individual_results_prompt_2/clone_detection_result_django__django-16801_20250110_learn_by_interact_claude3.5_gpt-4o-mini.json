    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks if a model class is not abstract and if it has defined width or height fields; if so, it connects a signal to update those dimensions after the model instantiation. The 'update_dimension_fields' method is defined to update the width and height fields of an instance if they are defined. In code sample 2, the logic is similar; it also checks if the model class is not abstract and if it has width or height fields, also connecting to the same signal. However, the comments and some parts of the 'update_dimension_fields' method differ from sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar, but there are changes in comments and additional logic related to updating dimensions, making them not identical.\"}"

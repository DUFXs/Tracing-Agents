    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 includes a class_path variable assignment which utilizes the __qualname__ attribute to form a nested path string. Additionally, it contains commented-out documentation suggesting the use of __qualname__. Code sample 2, on the other hand, does not include any comments regarding __qualname__, and it directly assigns klass.__qualname__ to class_path in the return statement without the preceding variable assignment. The return statement structure is similar but differs in the assignment style. Overall, the two samples are very close in structure but differ in the specifics of how they handle the class_path assignment and comment presence.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are considered type-3 clones because they exhibit syntactic similarity but involve added or removed statements and differences in comment usage.\"}"

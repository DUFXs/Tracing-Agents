    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function that normalizes a string by removing accents from characters that can be represented in ASCII. It uses the `unicodedata` library to normalize the input string and filters out combining characters. The function returns the ASCII-only representation of the input string. The code sample begins by referencing comments about removing accentuated characters. In code sample 2, a similar function is present that aims to achieve the same outcome, but includes a try-except block to handle cases where the input string is ASCII-compatible. This means that if the string can be encoded in ASCII without errors, it is returned as-is without accent removal. If a UnicodeEncodeError occurs, it proceeds to normalize the string. While both pieces of code have similar functionality, there are significant differences in their structure and the approach used for handling ASCII-compatible strings.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but differ due to the presence of the try-except block and the added statements for handling ASCII compatibility in code sample 2.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 primarily sets up a simple test suite for the OPTICS clustering algorithm from the sklearn library. It generates a random dataset of two-dimensional points, then runs three test cases where it fits the OPTICS model with varying values of 'min_samples' and prints the results. Code sample 2, on the other hand, appears to contain documentation from the scipy sklearn OPTICS implementation, which describes parameters used by the OPTICS clustering algorithm, specifically focusing on 'min_samples' and related concepts. It includes details about the behavior of the algorithm based on different settings for 'min_samples' and other parameters.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 contains functional code that executes clustering tests, while code sample 2 contains extensive documentation and parameter descriptions related to the OPTICS algorithm, indicating they serve completely different purposes.\"}"

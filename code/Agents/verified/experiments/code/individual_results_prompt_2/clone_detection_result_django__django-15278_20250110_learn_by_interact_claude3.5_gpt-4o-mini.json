    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method `add_field` that handles adding a field to a model in a database schema. It includes checks for various conditions on the field (like whether it can be null or if it's a OneToOneField) that determine whether to remake the table or to call a superclass method for adding the field. The comments explain limitations related to SQLite's ALTER TABLE command. The code in code sample 2 also defines a similar method `add_field`, but has a different structure and explanation in comments related to primary keys and unique fields that are not supported by SQLite. Both versions contain logic to add fields with noteworthy relational constraints. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar with added and modified statements, particularly in how they handle comments and the checks on the field.\"}"

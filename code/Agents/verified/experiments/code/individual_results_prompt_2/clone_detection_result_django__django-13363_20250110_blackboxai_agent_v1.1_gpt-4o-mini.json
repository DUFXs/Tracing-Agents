    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines two methods named as_sql. The first method casts a value to a date using a SQL operation, and the second method casts to a time instead, with both methods compiling a left-hand side expression and returning a SQL statement along with parameters. Code sample 2 also defines similar methods as_sql with the same functionality. However, there are minor differences in whitespace, particularly with the usage of the tzname variable, where the second sample includes an additional conditional check for settings.USE_TZ. This difference suggests that while the structure is similar, the code is altered slightly in terms of its output.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they have differences in whitespace and a significant line adjustment resulting in varied functionality.\"}"

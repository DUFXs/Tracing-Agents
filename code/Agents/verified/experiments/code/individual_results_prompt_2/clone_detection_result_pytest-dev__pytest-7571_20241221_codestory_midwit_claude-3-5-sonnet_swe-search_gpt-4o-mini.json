    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a test function using the pytest framework that logs messages to verify the logging level of a logger before and after it is set to a specific level, demonstrating how log levels can be adjusted in a testing environment. It also includes an initializer for managing logging levels. The code sample 2 is a modified part of a logging initialization function that manages logger levels, but it changes details such as the handling of initial logger levels and includes conditions based on a handler level, which makes it functionally different from the first sample. Additionally, code sample 2 includes comments and logic that alters the method of setting levels compared to code sample 1. Therefore, fundamentally they differ significantly in structure and logic.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes and exhibit differences in the logic for managing logging levels. Specifically, they are not similar in terms of syntax or functional equivalence.\"}"

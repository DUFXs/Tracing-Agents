Specific test cases are defined that sum different combinations of vectors, including cases with zero vectors. The code in code sample 2 consists only of the definition of the __add__ method for Vector, which handles the addition of vectors and accounts for the case when another vector is zero. The code samples differ significantly in context and functionality, as one is a testing script while the other is a method definition.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve very different purposes and structures, with one being a complete testing script and the other solely a method definition.\"}"

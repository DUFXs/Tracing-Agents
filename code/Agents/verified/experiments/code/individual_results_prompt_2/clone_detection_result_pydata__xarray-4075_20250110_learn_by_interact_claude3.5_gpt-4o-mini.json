    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 initializes two DataArray objects, one for data (dta) with values [1.0, 1.0, 1.0] and another for weights (wgt) with values [1, 1, 0]. It then calculates the weighted mean of the data using the weights and prints the result along with an expected value of 1.0. The code sample also includes a comment about calculating the sum of weights while handling missing values. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 focuses on calculating the sum of weights and includes checks for missing values within the weights and whether the weights are of boolean type. It incorporates additional logic to convert boolean weights to integer values and marks valid weights, which are not equal to zero. The two code snippets are similar in their purpose of handling weights and data, but they functionally implement different mechanisms to achieve their goals.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they perform distinct functionalities even though they are related to the handling of weights in arrays. Sample 1 focuses on computation of a weighted mean while Sample 2 performs checks on weights and processes them differently.\"}"

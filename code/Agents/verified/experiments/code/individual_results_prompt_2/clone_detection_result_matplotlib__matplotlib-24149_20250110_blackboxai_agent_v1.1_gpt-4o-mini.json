    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 attempts to safely retrieve the first finite element from the variable x0 using the function cbook._safe_first_finite. If that fails due to a TypeError, IndexError, KeyError, or StopIteration, it uses a pass statement to ignore the error. Similarly, for xconv, it tries to obtain the first finite element and fallbacks to using xconv directly on failure. The code sample ends with setting a variable 'delist' to False. Meanwhile, code sample 2 also attempts to perform similar operations on x0 and x. However, it includes specific comments indicating fallback behavior if no finite element is found, and it uses cbook.safe_first_element in that scenario, implying that there may be an alternative logic in sample 2. Additionally, the 'except' clauses and error handling structure in sample 2 is slightly altered. Therefore, although they share similar intentions and structures, the differences in identifier usage, comments, and some logic indicate that they are not entirely identical. It appears to be cases of syntactic similarity with added or modified statements, which classifies them as type-3 clones.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but contain added comments and modified logical structure.\"}"

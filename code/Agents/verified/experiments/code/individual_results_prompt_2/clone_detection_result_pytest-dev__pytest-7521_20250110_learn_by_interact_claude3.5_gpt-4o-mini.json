    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is implementing a fixture for capturing output during tests, specifically handling line endings in a way that preserves carriage returns and handles different formats correctly. It reads raw bytes from a temporary file and decodes it, ensuring that any carriage return characters are maintained. The code also includes tests for various outputs with carriage returns and line feeds. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 appears to be part of the same setup but includes a temporary file creation function with specific buffering and error handling configurations, and it prepares to read the captured output, but it is less complete compared to code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they contain different context and functionality, albeit related. Sample 1 focuses on implementing a capture function, while sample 2 shows a file handling configuration without further capturing logic.\"}"

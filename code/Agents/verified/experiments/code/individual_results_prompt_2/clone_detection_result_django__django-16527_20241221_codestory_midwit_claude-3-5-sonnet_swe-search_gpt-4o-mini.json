    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a function that determines various permissions and configurations for rendering admin buttons in a Django application, specifically handling visibility for the save and delete actions. The sample involves a dictionary representing the context in which the admin views are rendered. The context includes permissions such as whether to show the save button based on whether the user has add and change permissions. The code also concludes with print statements for testing outcomes based on modified contexts. Meanwhile, code sample 2 appears to be a snippet that ties into the same functionality regarding the permissions and inclusion of various options in the admin interface, specifically adding the 'show_save_and_add_another' option while still addressing the same factors for determining the save visibility as in sample 1. However, sample 2 lacks context-related print statements and tests seen in sample 1, offering a smaller focus on the dictionary definitions. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar, but code sample 2 has additional content and modification, specifically with the inclusion of 'show_save_and_add_another', indicating a structural difference, even though they are related in function.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method called _arithmetic_mask which calculates the resulting mask based on the provided operands and a handle_mask function. It checks various conditions regarding the existence of masks for both operands and returns the appropriate mask or None. Additionally, it defines another method _arithmetic_wcs, but the details of that method are not fully included. The explanations and return statements for the conditions are comprehensive. In contrast, code sample 2 appears to be a small fragment related to the _arithmetic_mask method, dealing specifically with the situation where one of the operands has no mask; it returns the mask of the operand or self if applicable, without repeating the initial comments or documentation found in sample 1. This sample ends with an incomplete definition of the _arithmetic_wcs method as well. Therefore, the provided logic and functionality seem very similar even though the second sample is more condensed and focuses on specific conditions within the mask calculation.\",\"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they exhibit syntactical similarity but with some added or modified statements and different levels of detail.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 sets up a minimal Django environment, configures settings, and calls the method `get_swappable_settings_name` to demonstrate cache behavior before and after clearing the cache. It also prints the cache information. The code in code sample 2 contains a portion of the Django app that appears to call `cache_clear` on `get_swappable_settings_name` and includes comments before and after. However, it does not setup the Django settings or demonstrate the cache checks fully as in sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but code sample 1 has additional context and more operations related to caching, while code sample 2 is incomplete and only represents a subset of that functionality.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains logic to compute outputs for two models, `left` and `right`, using their types to differentiate how to process them. If they are of certain compound model types, it recursively computes separability; otherwise, it uses coordinate matrices. The results are stacked horizontally and returned. The code also initializes and prepares arrays for cases where the inputs are not models. In contrast, code sample 2 is just a snippet from code sample 1, specifically showing the part that handles the `right` model processing and the final return statement for the combined output. It does not include any of the initialization and logic detailing how the `left` model is processed.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because code sample 2 is a continuation of the logic from code sample 1, differing only in the extent of code and not in content or syntactic structure.\"}"

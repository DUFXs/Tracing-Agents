    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 seems to handle the action of logging when no changes are detected in database migrations and proceeds to either update migration files or write them to the last migration files. It also contains a method to write to the last migration files which utilizes a MigrationLoader. Conversely, code sample 2 includes additional argument parsing functionality for a command-line interface, which checks for model changes in database migrations and can optionally run without writing those changes if specified. However, it also incorporates the same logic for logging when no changes are detected and the subsequent actions to take in both cases.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they have similar overall structures but differ due to additional and removed statements, particularly around argument handling and command-line interface functionalities.\"}"

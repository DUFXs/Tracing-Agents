    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 handles the complement of a finite set A with respect to another set B, specifically for cases where B is either a union of sets or is an interval. It filters elements of A into numeric and symbolic, and based on their presence outside the interval or other conditions, it returns different combinations of finite sets. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 appears to be part of a method dealing with the symmetric difference of sets, where it defines a function that uses the 'sift' utility from 'sympy' to manage elements in relation to whether they are contained in 'self', returning an appropriate union of those that are not contained and making adjustments based on the evaluation context. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they have different purposes and functionalities; the first sample focuses on set complements while the second handles the symmetric difference of sets, with distinct logic and methods being applied.\"}"

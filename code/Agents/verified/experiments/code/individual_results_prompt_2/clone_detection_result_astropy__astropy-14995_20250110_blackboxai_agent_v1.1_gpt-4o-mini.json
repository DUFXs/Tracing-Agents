It also includes some simplification of logical conditions. The purpose is to manage masks when performing arithmetic operations on data potentially containing masks. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 appears to perform similar logic but includes some variations in the conditional checks and the comments, like the way it handles the None checks and wording in comments. This indicates they are handling similar operations with some differences in presentation and logic flow. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have added, modified, or removed statements related to the assignment of masks during operations.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 handles test outcomes in pytest, where it checks conditions for marking tests as skipped, failed, or normal xfail exceptions, and reports the test status accordingly. It includes logic for writing and running a test that is expected to be skipped based on specific criteria. Meanwhile, the code in code sample 2 also deals with the test outcome but focuses on labeling a test as passed if certain conditions about skipped tests are met. It contains parts of the reporting logic.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they address different logic and contexts within test reporting; while both are related to pytest, they operate on separate aspects of test outcomes without significant syntactical similarity.\"}"

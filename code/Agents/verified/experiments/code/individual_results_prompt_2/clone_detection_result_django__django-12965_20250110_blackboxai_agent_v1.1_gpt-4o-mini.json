    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 implements a function that checks if a specific query has a single alias by summing the reference counts of aliases in the query and returning a boolean value. It also defines a method '_as_sql' which generates SQL commands based on the query's structure, handling cases for direct DELETE commands and complex queries with joins. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 defines a class 'SQLDeleteCompiler' which extends 'SQLCompiler' and includes a method 'single_alias' that ensures the base table is included in the alias list. The second sample lacks the complexity and context present in the first sample, focusing solely on the alias check. Additionally, it does not include the SQL generation part present in code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they contain different levels of functionality and context, with code sample 1 including substantial logic for SQL creation, while code sample 2 only addresses alias management within a class structure.\"}"

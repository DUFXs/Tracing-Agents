    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 initializes a variable 'hit' to False and checks if the string 's' contains parentheses without having matching quotes. It also prepares a variable 'kern' and checks if quotes are present in 's'. Meanwhile, the code in code sample 2 appears to be dealing with a substitution operation where the variable 'kern' is appended to 's' when 'kern' is found in it. If found, it updates 'hit' accordingly. It includes logic to replace spaces with the value of 'kern' which is built from random choices of letters and digits.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they have different functional behavior and achieve different outcomes. Code sample 1 focuses on checking conditions in 's' without changing it, while code sample 2 modifies 's' based on the presence of 'kern'.\"}"

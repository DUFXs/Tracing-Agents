    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 first checks if the first path in `sys.path` is either the empty string, '.', or the current working directory, in which case it removes the first entry of `sys.path`. It also gets the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable and if it starts with a colon but does not match the current working directory or '.', it continues to check other conditions. The code sample 1 has a specific set of operations without checking whether the `PYTHONPATH` ends with a colon. Conversely, code sample 2 performs a similar operation by checking if the first path in `sys.path` matches the same set of values and also retrieves the `PYTHONPATH`. However, it adds an additional condition to check if the `PYTHONPATH` ends with a colon and not only does it check for an empty path, but it also includes a new condition related to how it compares against `cwd`. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have added conditional logic and different arrangements of statements.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is primarily interacting with a foreign key field in a Django model, checking if it is an instance of 'models.ForeignKey' and managing the dependencies accordingly. It involves altering fields and ensuring that any field alterations are properly handled through operations like 'AlterField'. Meanwhile, the code in code sample 2 is working with renamed fields in a Django migration context and involves checking for dependencies on foreign key fields while handling model renames. It also includes aspects of extending dependencies based on linked models. Both samples are working in a migration context in Django, but they focus on different aspects (one focuses more on field operations, while the other on renaming fields and managing dependencies).\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because while they operate within the same domain (Django migrations) and have some overlapping concepts (foreign key dependencies), they deal with different operations and have different structures, thus qualifying as semantically and syntactically dissimilar.\"}"

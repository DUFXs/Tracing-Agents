    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a property called 'mode' that returns the mode of a buffer object without the 'b' character to indicate text mode. It also has a 'write' method that encodes an object if it is of type 'text_type' using a specified encoding. Meanwhile, code sample 2 includes a similar property 'mode' which also returns the mode of the buffer but does it directly from 'self.buffer.mode'. It also defines a '__getattr__' method that retrieves attributes from the 'buffer' object. Both snippets pertain to handling buffer objects, specifically regarding modes and how data is written or retrieved from them.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they exhibit significant structural differences: code sample 1 has a write method that is absent in code sample 2, and code sample 2 has a '__getattr__' method that is not present in code sample 1. Additionally, the implementations of the mode property differ, indicating that they are not merely variations of each other.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 initializes paths from adjustable_paths and sets up substitutions and post-processing for static files in Django. It handles the configuration of Django settings and creates a storage instance to save and process a test file. In contrast, code sample 2 focuses specifically on a line that processes adjustable paths and assigns them processed values. It does not include broader context or functionality like the first sample, but it shares a specific line that involves processing adjustable paths.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share syntactic similarities. Code sample 2 is a snippet from code sample 1 that shows a similar line of code but lacks the full context and surrounding functionality. While they are not identical in their entirety, they exhibit a common structure and behavior related to processing paths.\"}"

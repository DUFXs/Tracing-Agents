    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 processes a list of variables called 'item' and counts the occurrences of each variable, storing these counts in a dictionary called 'powers'. It then calculates the total count of variables and checks if this total is within a specified range (between 'min_degree' and 'max_degree'). If it is, it appends the item to 'monomials_list_comm' (for commutative monomials) and yields the unique values from this list. For the 'else' condition, it does the same for 'monomials_list_non_comm'. The code sample has a structure that suggests it's part of a larger function. The overall logic is similar in code sample 2, which performs the same count and checks, but has a slight modification to the condition that checks the total sum. Instead of checking if the total is between 'min_degree' and 'max_degree', it checks if the total is greater than or equal to 'min_degree'.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have a modification in one of the conditions where sample 2 uses '>= min_degree' instead of 'min_degree <= total <= max_degree', making them differ syntactically but functionally they are performing similar operations.\"}"

It compiles the condition using a provided compiler and incorporates it into a set of template parameters. The code then extends SQL parameters based on the compiled condition. Conversely, the code in code sample 2 also compiles parameters for a SQL query but includes additional logic for handling predicates in a CASE WHEN expression. Instead of defaulting to true when the condition is empty, it compiles a True value explicitly to ensure it always matches. Both samples deal with constructing SQL queries but differ in logic handling.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they involve different logical handling of an empty SQL condition, making them syntactically dissimilar as well as functionally different.\"}"

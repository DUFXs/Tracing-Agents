    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines methods for a similarity checker that appears to be part of a linting tool. The methods include 'run', which starts looking for similarities, and '_compute_sims', which seems to calculate those similarities. Additionally, there is a 'close' method that handles the cleanup and computation of statistics regarding duplicate lines. The code also includes checks to skip the calculation if the 'min_lines' is set to zero. In code sample 2, the same 'run' method with its associated functionality is present, but it is incomplete as it lacks further code details like '_compute_sims' or 'close'. This code appears to focus more on the initial setup of the similarity functionality.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace and layout.\"}"

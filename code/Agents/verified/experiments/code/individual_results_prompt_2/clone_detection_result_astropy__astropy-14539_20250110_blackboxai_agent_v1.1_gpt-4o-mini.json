    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 and code sample 2 both contain a snippet of a patch for the same file, specifically focused on the handling of array types and comparisons within the context of the 'astropy' library. Both snippets include lines of code that deal with checking the data type of two arrays (arrb and arra) and performing element-wise comparisons. However, code sample 1 contains additional context about the patching process that is not included in code sample 2. Therefore, the core logic regarding array comparisons is the same with only minor differences in surrounding context, but the key functional code remains identical.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for minor differences in whitespace and layout.\"}"

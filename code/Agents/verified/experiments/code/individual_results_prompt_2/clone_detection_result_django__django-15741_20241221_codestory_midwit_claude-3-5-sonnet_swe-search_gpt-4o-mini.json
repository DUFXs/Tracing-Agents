    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 pertains to the configuration and setup of Django, specifically focusing on localization settings. It checks if a value can be forced to be localized and converts it to a string if necessary. This code follows by initializing Django settings and attempting to use a lazy string format. If an error occurs during this usage, it prints a message. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 appears to handle a different aspect of localization\u2014specifically, handling if `use_l10n` is enabled and potentially retrieving a language setting. It also formats a type and checks against a cache. The two samples exhibit different functional scopes and behavior regarding how localization is processed.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they address different functionalities related to localization in Django, with differing contexts and operations being performed.\"}"

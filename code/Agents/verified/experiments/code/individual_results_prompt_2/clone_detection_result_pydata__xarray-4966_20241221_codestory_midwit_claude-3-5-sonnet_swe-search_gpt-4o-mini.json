    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a new file that tests the loading of a netCDF dataset using both the 'netcdf4' and 'pydap' engines. It prints the datasets loaded with both engines and checks for negative values in the first test. The second part of the patch seems to deal with the conversion of data types in a numpy array, particularly handling unsigned/signed data types and fill values. The code in code sample 2 seems to be a continuation or part of the same routine regarding the handling of '_FillValue' attributes in a dataset and how they are assigned based on the data type. It checks conditions to modify attributes but doesn't include the opening or closing context for the function it belongs to. Both samples are modifying behavior related to data handling but the second code sample is a partial extraction from the function. Therefore, the majority of the logic is similar, but the first sample is broader, as it includes additional context and logic that the second does not.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because while they are syntactically similar with the presence of assignment and condition checks, code sample 1 contains the broader context of data handling, whereas code sample 2 only contains segments related to the '_FillValue' attribute handling.\"}"

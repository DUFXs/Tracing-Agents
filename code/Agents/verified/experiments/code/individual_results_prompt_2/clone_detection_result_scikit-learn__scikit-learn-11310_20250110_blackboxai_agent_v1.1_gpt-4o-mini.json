    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 handles the process of refitting the best estimator in a cross-validation setting, timing the refit operation and storing the refit time. It checks if the refit parameter is enabled and fits the estimator with provided parameters. It also determines the scorer to use for evaluation based on whether multiple metrics are being considered. The code in code sample 2 also deals with the refitting process and timing, but it includes additional import statements and comments about parameters relevant to cross-validation splits and refitting. It introduces a slightly different structure for the timing of the refit, using different variable names but ultimately achieving similar functionality.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they exhibit syntactical similarities in handling the refitting of a model with differences in added or modified statements (like the extra imports and comments in sample 2). The core functionality remains aligned.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is primarily dealing with class retrieval from a module based on its string path, checking global variables first, and handling exceptions. The code attempts to use the cls_path to access class data dynamically. The code in code sample 2, while showing class definition and imports, starts similarly by splitting cls_path into modules and reducing them to reach the class. However, it calls a method from the inspect module rather than directly accessing globals. Thus, both samples focus on dynamic class retrieval but differ slightly in the implementation details.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they exhibit syntactic similarity with modifications in implementation details, such as how globals are accessed in the second sample.\"}"

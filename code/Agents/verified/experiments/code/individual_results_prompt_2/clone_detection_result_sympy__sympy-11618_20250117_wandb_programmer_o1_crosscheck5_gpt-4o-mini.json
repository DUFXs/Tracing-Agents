    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 implements a distance calculation between two points in a potentially multi-dimensional space using the SymPy library. It defines a 'main' function that tests the functionality by creating two points, calculating their distance, and checking it against an expected value. If the computed distance is close to the expected distance, it prints a success message; otherwise, it prints a failure message. The second sample (code sample 2) is part of a method definition for calculating the distance between two Points. It includes handling for different dimensions by padding with zeros when points have mismatched dimensions. It also provides a Taxicab distance method. The method checks the types of the inputs and manages the calculations accordingly.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes and implement different algorithms for calculating distances. Code sample 1 tests the functionality, while code sample 2 is a method implementation.\"}"

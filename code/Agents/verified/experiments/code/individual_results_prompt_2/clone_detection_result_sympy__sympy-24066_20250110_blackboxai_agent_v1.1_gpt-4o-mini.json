    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 seems to involve handling expressions in a mathematical or physical context, particularly related to dimensions and quantities. It checks if the expression is of a certain function (in this case, the exponential function) and ensures that the arguments passed to it are dimensionless. If they are not, it raises a ValueError. The purpose appears to be managing dimensional analysis in physical equations. The code in code sample 2 also deals with expressions, particularly collecting factors and their dimensions, and includes logic for handling situations where different dimensions are involved. It constructs two lists of dimensions and returns a tuple of values, transforming the input based on the dimension system. Both examples are part of the same functionality related to dimension handling but handle slightly different cases of expressions.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share structural similarities but with added and modified statements, indicating that while they are related in functionality, they differ in how they implement that functionality.\"}"

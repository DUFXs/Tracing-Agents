    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a Python snippet that opens a temporary file with specified encoding and error handling options, writes through to it, and checks if a target file descriptor is included in a dictionary to create a `SysCapture` object. The code in code sample 2 performs a similar operation of creating a temporary file with specific buffering settings and uses the same parameters for encoding and error handling, followed by checking if a target file descriptor exists in the same context. Both samples are working with similar logic and configurations for file handling.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-2\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are identical in structure and functionality but differ in a slight modification regarding the temporary file handling.\"}"

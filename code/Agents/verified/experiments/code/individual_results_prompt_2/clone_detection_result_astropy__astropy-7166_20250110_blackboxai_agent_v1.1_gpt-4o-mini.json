    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is focused on handling properties and methods within a class, checking for public members and their documentation, and potentially creating new properties with inherited documentation. It specifically checks if each key in a dictionary is a public member and has no docstring, and if so, it assigns documentation from a super class property if it exists. The code in code sample 2 appears to import various utilities and also contains similar logic regarding checking for public members, but it includes additional context such as module documentation and imports unrelated to the main logic of inspecting properties or functions. There are similarities in the core functionality, but the surrounding context diverges significantly. Therefore, the samples are not clones. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they have significant differences in context and functionality beyond just formatting differences. Although they share some similar checks, the structure and surrounding code create functional and syntactic differences.\"}"

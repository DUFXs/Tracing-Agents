    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 and code sample 2 are nearly identical. Both samples contain a piece of code that checks if an attribute (`attname`) does not exist on the class (`cls`), then sets it using `setattr`. They also check if `choices` is not `None` and conditionally set another attribute based on the method name formed using `get_%s_display`. The main difference in these code samples is the formatting and whitespace, with some parts being more neatly formatted in code sample 1 and fewer lines present in code sample 2. However, the actual logic and structure remain unchanged.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in terms of code logic, with only differences in whitespace and formatting.\"}"

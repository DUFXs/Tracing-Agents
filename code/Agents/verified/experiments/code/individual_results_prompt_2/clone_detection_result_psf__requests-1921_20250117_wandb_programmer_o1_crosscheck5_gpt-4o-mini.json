    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is a method that appropriately merges settings from a request and a session, taking into account that the settings can be dictionaries. It checks whether the session setting is None and ensures to bypass merging if the settings are not dictionaries. After merging the settings, it removes any keys with a value of None from the merged dictionary and returns the final merged settings. The code also defines a merge_hooks function. Meanwhile, code sample 2 contains a portion that checks a condition where if a value is None when iterating over merged settings, it deletes that key from the final dictionary. Additionally, it creates a merged dictionary using a dictionary comprehension to exclude any items where the value is None. Both code samples focus on the handling of merged settings, but sample 2 adds a dictionary comprehension to remove None values.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar in handling merged settings, but sample 2 modifies the way it removes None values using a dictionary comprehension making it a modification of the original logic.\"}"

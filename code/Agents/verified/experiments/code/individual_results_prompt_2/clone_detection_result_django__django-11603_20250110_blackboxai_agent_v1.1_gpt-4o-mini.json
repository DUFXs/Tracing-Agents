    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines several classes related to database aggregation in Django, specifically the classes Avg, Count, Sum, and Variance which inherit from different mixins and Aggregate. Each class has specific properties such as 'function', 'name', and 'allow_distinct'. The code also includes some comments regarding ignored files for version control. Meanwhile, the code in code sample 2 is essentially a similar definition of the same classes (Avg, Count, Sum, Variance) with the same content and properties. The main difference is the presence of additional context in code sample 1, which includes some version control metadata in the patch information.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in structure and functionality, only differing in their layout and the presence of additional metadata in code sample 1.\"}"

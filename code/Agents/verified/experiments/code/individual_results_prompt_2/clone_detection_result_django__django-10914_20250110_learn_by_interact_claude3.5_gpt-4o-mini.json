    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines settings for file upload permissions in Django, including the numeric mode for newly-uploaded files and directories. It sets 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' to '0o644' and includes a placeholder for 'FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS' and other security-related settings. The code sample 2 similarly describes file upload permissions and mentions the directory settings but doesn't include the complete set of configurations found in code sample 1, making it less comprehensive.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 2 is a partial excerpt of code sample 1; it lacks some variables and functionality. Thus, they differ significantly in their completeness and do not match any clone type.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 shows a patch that includes a method for handling lookups in a Django model's query utilities. It checks if 'lookup_name' is None and assigns a lookup name if necessary. It also manages a dictionary of class lookups by deleting a specific lookup and clearing cached lookups. Additionally, there is a definition for a function 'select_related_descend' which builds and compiles a query based on certain conditions. In contrast, code sample 2 is much shorter and contains only a fragment of the same patch, focusing on the same methods but without any initialization of the class or context provided. It does not include any of the surrounding code or functionality that is present in the first sample.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in functionality and structure except for differences in whitespace and layout.\"}"

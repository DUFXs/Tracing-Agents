    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a class `MinMaxBase` that is meant to handle operations related to minimum and maximum values. In the `__new__` method, it checks if any arguments were provided; if not, it returns `cls.identity`. It then converts each argument into a sympy expression using `sympify`, and has a method `_eval_is_negative` that checks if any of the instance's arguments are negative using `fuzzy_or`. The code in code sample 2 also defines the same class `MinMaxBase` and includes a simplified version of the `__new__` method that only includes the argument conversion into a sympy expression. It does not contain the logic for returning identity values or checking if arguments are negative.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but differ in the presence and content of certain statements and logic.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a utility in Django to calculate the time since a given datetime, detailing how to represent that difference in a human-readable format. It sets up necessary imports, defines constants for time strings, and handles adjustments for timezone awareness. The provided snippet includes part of the logic for handling datetime differences, working with the components of time such as hours, minutes, and seconds. The code in code sample 2 appears to be a continuation of that logic from code sample 1, specifically dealing with the extraction of the timezone information from a datetime object. It completes a structure that was started in code sample 1, indicating it might be part of an implementation that defines the behavior of a function related to datetime calculations.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace and layout. The core logic remains unchanged, and the second code sample simply extends the first without any modification to the logic itself.\"}"

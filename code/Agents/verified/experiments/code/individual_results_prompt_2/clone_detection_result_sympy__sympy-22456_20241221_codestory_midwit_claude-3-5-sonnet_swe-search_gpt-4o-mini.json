    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 creates a String instance using the SymPy library and tests its argument invariance by printing the original string and its arguments, verifying its compatibility with *args and **kwargs syntax. It includes equality tests to check if the results match the original string. Meanwhile, the code in code sample 2 defines a class called String that represents a string object within the SymPy library. It includes methods such as '_sympystr' to return its string representation and a property 'func' that returns a lambda function. This code outlines the structure and functionality of the String class and its derived class QuotedString.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 deals with testing the functionality of a String instance's methods, while code sample 2 defines the structure and functionalities of the String class. They serve different purposes and have different levels of detail, making them functionally and syntactically distinct.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is primarily dealing with a paginator in Django, where it returns a range of pages based on the total number of pages ('self.num_pages'). It also includes an iterator method that allows iterating over the pages in the paginator. The second part involves checking if the object list is ordered. In contrast, code sample 2 starts with setting some properties for pagination, specifically the number of orphaned pages and whether an empty first page is allowed. It continues with the __iter__ method, where it yields pages based on the page number, and it also includes a method for validating the page numbers.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different functionalities in pagination, with distinct roles in the paginator class. The first sample focuses on returning a page range and checking order, while the second sample involves validating page numbers and managing attributes for pagination.\"}"

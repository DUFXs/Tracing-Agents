    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is parsing a URL and handling exceptions for invalid labels, raising an InvalidURL exception if there are issues with the URL components such as an empty label or invalid format. It also includes additional validation for the host portion of the URL. Conversely, in code sample 2, the code is checking the host after it has been processed for international domain names and is raising an InvalidURL exception if the host starts with certain invalid characters. Both samples deal with URL validation but handle different aspects of it.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they involve different stages and aspects of URL validation, with no syntactic or structural similarities, thus they are functionally distinct.\"}"

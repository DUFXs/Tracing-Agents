    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function 'partitions' which generates all partitions of a positive integer, 'n', along with a helper function 'ordered_partitions' which is likely meant to return these partitions in an ordered manner. This part of the code includes handling for input parameters and potential room constraints for the partitions. Code sample 2 appears to be an incomplete patch related to the same functionality, showing part of the same 'ordered_partitions' function but lacking the context of the rest of the code. It includes some return values and mappings related to partitions but does not define any complete behavior or main functions as in the first sample. Both pieces are related to generating and validating partitions of integers, but the second sample is mostly missing significant context that defines its functionality. Since both code samples refer to the same functions and structure, they present a form of similarities but lack complete structural and functional connections, indicating a resemblance without being complete clones.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 2 does not complete or duplicate the functionality outlined in code sample 1. Although they share context regarding the same functionality (partitions), they do not directly correlate in terms of complete structure or functionality, thus classifying them as dissimilar.\"}"

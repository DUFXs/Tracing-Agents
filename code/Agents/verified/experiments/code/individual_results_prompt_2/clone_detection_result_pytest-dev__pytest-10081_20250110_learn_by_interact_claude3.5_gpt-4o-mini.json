    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks if a certain condition related to the `usepdb` option is met and if certain objects are not skipped before assigning a tearDown method. It defines a helper function `_is_skipped` to determine if an object is marked as skipped. The code in code sample 2 also checks conditions related to the `usepdb` option and whether an object is skipped but it uses a different approach to determine if the test or the class is skipped, using an assertion and a combined check. Both samples modify the behavior of the tearDown method based on these conditions.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because, although they share some similar logic, they differ significantly in structure and specific conditions, indicating that they are not syntactically similar.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 implements the _complement method in a set class that computes the complement of a given set. It handles different types of input sets, including ProductSet, Interval, Union, Complement, EmptySet, and FiniteSet, executing various logic to return the appropriate complement. The code employs conditional checks and handles different scenarios of set membership. Additionally, there is a symmetric_difference method, which is incomplete in the provided sample. The code in code sample 2 continues beyond the provided portion of the first sample, likely finishing the implementation of the symmetric_difference method and introduces a new helper function, ternary_sift, to filter elements from a FiniteSet based on membership in self. It utilizes the sift function to separate elements into contained and not-contained categories, handling unknown membership with a structured approach. Both samples contain a symmetric_difference method but are implemented differently with different handling of element membership.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they exhibit syntactical similarities, with the second sample adding a new method and modifying methods from the first sample without keeping them identical.\"}"

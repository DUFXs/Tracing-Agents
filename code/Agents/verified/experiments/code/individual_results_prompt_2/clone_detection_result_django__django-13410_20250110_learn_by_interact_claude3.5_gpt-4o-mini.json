    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 implements a locking mechanism using file descriptors, where two functions, lock() and unlock(), are defined. The lock() function attempts to acquire a lock on a file; it handles an OSError and returns False if locking fails. The unlock() function releases the lock on the file and also handles an OSError to return False on failure. There is also a test function, test_file_locking(), that creates a temporary file, attempts to acquire locks, and prints the results. The code in code sample 2 contains a similar implementation of the lock() and unlock() functions, but it differs in the exception type from OSError to BlockingIOError in the lock() function. The unlock() function is simplified and only releases the lock without exception handling. However, it lacks the testing logic present in code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they have similar logical structures but differ in exception handling and the presence of a test function.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines methods related to the management of contour set paths in a collection. It has a method to set paths, clear old cached collections, and retrieve the state for pickling, indicating that it deals with contour plots in matplotlib. Meanwhile, code sample 2 deals with methods to manage paths in a collection as well, including a method to set paths, retrieve paths, and an indication of whether the object is stale, implying the management of paths and their transformations. Despite some overlap in context, the methods and functionality differ, particularly in the presence of different method implementations and variable usages.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they differ significantly in their method implementations and overall functionality, thus exhibiting syntactic dissimilarity.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 and code sample 2 both contain the same functionality regarding the management of cached lookups in Django's ORM. Specifically, they check if 'lookup_name' is None, assign it if necessary, delete an entry from 'cls.class_lookups', clear cached lookups, and define the function 'select_related_descend'. There is no difference in the actual code logic between the two samples, just a difference in the context (the inclusion of the .gitignore file in code sample 1).\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for the additional context provided in code sample 1, which includes a gitignore entry that doesn't affect the core code itself.\"}"

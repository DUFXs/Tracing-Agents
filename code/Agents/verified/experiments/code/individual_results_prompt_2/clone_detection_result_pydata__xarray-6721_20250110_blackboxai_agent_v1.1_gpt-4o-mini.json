Specifically, they initialize a dictionary called 'chunks' for storing the sizes of variables if they have the '_data' attribute that includes chunks. They go through a list of variables, checking each variable's dimensions and their corresponding sizes, raising a ValueError if there is a discrepancy in existing chunk sizes. However, the main difference lies in the extra information included in code sample 1's patch about '.gitignore', which is not part of the functionality being discussed.\",\"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for the differences regarding whitespace and layout, with code sample 1 having additional context in its patch that does not affect the core logic presented in both samples.\"}"

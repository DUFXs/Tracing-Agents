    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines several mathematical expressions using quaternion components (q.a, q.b, q.c, and q.d) and a scalar (s), likely part of some quaternion computation. It appears to be involved in generating specific quaternion results. The code in code sample 2 performs the same set of quaternion calculations as in code sample 1, focusing on the same expressions and variables. The only difference is the inclusion of an additional 'gitignore' entry in sample 1 that does not affect the quaternion calculations.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace and the inclusion of a 'gitignore' entry in code sample 1.\"}"

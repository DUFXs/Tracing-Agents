    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function `set_paths(self, new_paths)` in a class that sets the attribute `_paths` to `new_paths` and marks the object as changed by calling `self.changed()`. It also has a testing function that sets up a contour plot and tests if `cs.set_paths([])` runs without throwing an exception, signaling correct functionality. The code in code sample 2 defines the `set_paths(self, paths)` method in a different class that simply assigns the incoming `paths` to `_paths`, and sets a `stale` attribute to `True`. Additionally, it includes other methods that interact with paths and transforms in that class.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they define different classes and perform different operations related to path management. Although they share a method with similar names (`set_paths`), their functionality and context are different, indicating they are not clones.\"}"

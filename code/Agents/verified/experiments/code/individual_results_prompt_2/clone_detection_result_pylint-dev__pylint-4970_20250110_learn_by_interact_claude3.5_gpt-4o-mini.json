The 'run' method initiates the similarity check, while '_compute_sims' computes and returns similarities based on certain criteria. It includes a condition to return if no similarities are found. The overall context suggests it involves comparing sequences. Code sample 2 presents part of the same methods ('run' and '_compute_sims') but with less detail, omitting some lines and comments. It retains the same structure and logic but is clearly truncated.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace, layout, and comments.\"}"

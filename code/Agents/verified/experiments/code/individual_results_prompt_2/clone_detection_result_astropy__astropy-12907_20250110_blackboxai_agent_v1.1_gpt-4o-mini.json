    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 appears to be part of a function that calculates the separability of two models (left and right), which can either be simple models or compound models. It checks the types of the models involved and handles each case by computing a corresponding array that facilitates the separation or combining of outputs based on the specified operations. The code also initializes zero matrices for the outputs based on the shapes of the inputs. The return statement combines the two results, left and right, into a single output. Code sample 2 contains part of this same function but does not show the entire context or the initial checks\u2014specifically, it shows the handling of the right model and the return statement. However, it includes some lines from the same logic related to the right model. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar in structure and functionality, but code sample 2 is a partial view that potentially omits preceding conditional checks and statements from code sample 1.\"}"

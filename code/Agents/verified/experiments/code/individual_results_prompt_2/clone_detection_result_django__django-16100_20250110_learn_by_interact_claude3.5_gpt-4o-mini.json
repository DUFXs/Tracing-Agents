    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 handles the processing of a changelist view in a Django admin interface, ensuring that changes to objects within a formset are saved in a database transaction. It checks if the formset is valid, then iterates over the forms, saving any changed objects and logging these changes. The section begins with a permission check and raises a `PermissionDenied` if the user lacks sufficient permissions. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 also processes formset validation and saving of changed objects, but it explicitly uses a database routing mechanism when creating the atomic transaction. Additionally, it only includes parts of the change message construction and does not provide the denial handling present in the first sample. Both samples contain overlapping logic regarding form validation and management of changes but differ in specific implementations and lines of code.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they display syntactically similar structures but also include differences in statements, particularly related to the transaction handling.\"}"

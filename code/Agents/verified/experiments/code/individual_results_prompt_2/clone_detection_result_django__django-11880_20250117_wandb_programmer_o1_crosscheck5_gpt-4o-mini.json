    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 appears to be part of a method in a Django form field class that handles the deep copying of an object, specifically dealing with the widget and error messages attributes of that object. It uses `copy.deepcopy` to ensure that nested objects, such as the widget and error messages, are recursively copied, preventing shared references. The code in code sample 2 is a modification of the same or similar functionality, where it uses `copy.copy` instead to perform a shallow copy of the object first, and it modifies how the error messages are copied by using the `copy` method of the list instead of `deepcopy`. Essentially, both snippets aim to achieve object copying but differ in their specific implementations.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they have different approaches to copying the attributes of the object, one using deep copy while the other uses shallow copy. The structures and logic are similar, but they exhibit significant differences in behavior, indicating that they are not clones.\"}"

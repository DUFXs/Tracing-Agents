It appears to test various inputs represented by the parameter 'a'. The code also shows a section of the pytest source code that handles returning a string representation of parts, possibly from the Python module related to tests. The code in code sample 2 includes only a partial section of the source code related to pytest, dealing with breaking loops and returning string representations. It does not include the parameterized test function or any assertions. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they contain different functionality; code sample 1 is primarily a test function while code sample 2 deals with a specific implementation detail in the pytest library. They do not share enough structural similarities to be classified under any clone type.\"}"

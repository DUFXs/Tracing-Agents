    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks if all dimension coordinate values in a collection of datasets are equal, and if not, infers the order in which datasets should be arranged. It also checks monotonicity for coordinates that differ, raising a ValueError if any dimension is not monotonic. The code ensures that only relevant dimensions (that are concatenated) are considered by skipping those that are not, and includes comments explaining the logic. In contrast, code sample 2 focuses on checking if the overall coordinates of concatenated datasets are monotonically increasing. If not, it raises a ValueError and logs which dimension is problematic. Additionally, it has a return statement suggesting it is part of a larger function that merges data from concatenated datasets. However, although there are some functional similarities in terms of checking monotonicity, the contexts and specific implementations diverge.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they do not share structural similarity or identical logic, and they serve different purposes within the codebase.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines two classes, IntegerChoices and TextChoices, for creating enumerated integer and string choices in Django models, respectively. It also includes a function for generating the next value for TextChoices and overriding the __str__ method for string representation. The second code sample primarily introduces a class for Choices and an IntegerChoices class that inherits from it, presenting a simpler implementation than code sample 1. It does not define TextChoices at all and has less detailed comments. Overall, code sample 2 is a snippet of the earlier parts of the Django enums and has some differences in implementation and commenting.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they represent different parts of the codebase, one focusing on both IntegerChoices and TextChoices, while the other is more focused on the Choices base class. They are structurally different and serve different purposes despite sharing some elements.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 implements functionality for points using the sympy library, including the creation of points, addition with scalar multiplication, and verifying equality of results from different arithmetic expressions. Specifically, it creates two points, performs operations involving multiplication with a scalar, and asserts their results are equal. The code also contains multiple print statements to show intermediate results. On the other hand, code sample 2 appears to provide additional operations for the Point class, specifically the multiplication (__rmul__) and negation (__neg__) methods, as well as simplifying coordinates when multiplied. It also utilizes the simplify function while implementing these arithmetic operations.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 focuses on adding and comparing points with scalar multiplication, while code sample 2 introduces additional methods specifically for point manipulation (multiplication and negation) without directly relating to the operations in sample 1. Their functionalities and the context of operations differ significantly.\"}"

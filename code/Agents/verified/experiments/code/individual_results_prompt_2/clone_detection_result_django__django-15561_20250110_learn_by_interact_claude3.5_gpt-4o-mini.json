    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a list of non-database attributes that are to be ignored when making modifications to the schema. It iterates over this list to remove those attributes from `old_kwargs` and `new_kwargs`. The final part refers to executing an SQL command. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 also deals with non-database attributes but iterates through them for `old_field.non_db_attrs` and `new_field.non_db_attrs` while it performs similar operations of popping attributes from old and new keyword arguments. Additionally, sample 2 has return logic that is not present in sample 1 and mentions quoting field names. Overall, while both code samples share some closely related functionality involving `kwargs`, they have significant differences in the context of how they handle these attributes and the overall flow of logic.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they have different variable references, additional return logic in sample 2, and varying structural elements, indicating they are functionally divergent.\"}"

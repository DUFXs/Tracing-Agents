    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a list of non-database attributes that are not relevant for the database schema, such as 'blank', 'choices', and 'db_column'. This is likely part of a larger codebase that manages database schema and fields in a Django application. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 refers to a section of code that implements logic to handle old and new field attributes, ensuring that non-database attributes are not considered when comparing two fields, and it includes additional comments about changing field names. This code also discusses attributes that are ignored when altering a field, listing various attributes. Overall, both samples deal with managing attributes in a database schema context, but they do not represent identical or closely related logic. They differ in functionality and purpose.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they perform different functions regarding handling non-database attributes in the context of database schema management.\"}"

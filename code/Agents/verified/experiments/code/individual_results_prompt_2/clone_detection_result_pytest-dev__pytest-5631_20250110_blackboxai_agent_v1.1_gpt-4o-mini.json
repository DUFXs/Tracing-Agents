    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks if there are any mock modules present. If any exists, it retrieves their default sentinels and calculates the length of patchings that have no attribute name and match those sentinels. If no mock modules are present, it returns the length of patchings. In contrast, code sample 2 retrieves patchings from a function, and if they're absent, it returns 0. It also retrieves mock sentinels in a slightly different way and computes the length of patchings based on specific conditions for those sentinels. The two code samples perform similar operations regarding the handling of patchings and mock sentinels but with different identifications and checks. Thus, they exhibit some syntactical differences and are not entirely identical, suggesting they are not type-1 or type-2 clones. They might more closely resemble type-3 clones as they are syntactically similar but have differences in statements made and how they handle mock sentinels.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but contain added, modified, or removed statements.\"}"

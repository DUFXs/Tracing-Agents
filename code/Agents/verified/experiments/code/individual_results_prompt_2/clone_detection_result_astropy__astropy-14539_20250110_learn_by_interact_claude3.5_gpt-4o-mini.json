    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is handling the comparison of two arrays, arrb and arra, checking for various cases where they differ either by shape or by values, and storing the differing indices. It specifically handles cases for floating point and non-floating point arrays, using functions like np.allclose and np.array_equal. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 is incomplete and appears to be starting a new structure or function for handling the same logic, but it doesn't show the complete logic. It features an early return of `diffs` and a list structure that implies it may not be directly addressing comparisons yet.  As such, code sample 2 does not contain the full logic or context found in sample 1. Therefore, they are not clones as they serve different purposes and the second code sample does not represent a complete logic path present in the first one.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 2 is incomplete and does not fully implement the logic found in code sample 1.\"}"

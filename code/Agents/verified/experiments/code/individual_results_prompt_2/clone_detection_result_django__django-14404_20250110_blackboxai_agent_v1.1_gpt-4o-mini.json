    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function `catch_all_view` which handles incoming requests by checking if a URL should end with a trailing slash. If the setting `APPEND_SLASH` is enabled and the URL does not end with a slash, it tries to resolve the URL by appending a slash and attempting to find a matching view. If the resolution fails with a `Resolver404` exception, it silently passes. In code sample 2, the same function `catch_all_view` performs similar logic but with a slight difference in how it handles the matching resolution, as it refers to `request.path_info` instead of `request.path`. Additionally, it has extra logic that checks if the matched function should append a slash and returns an `HttpResponsePermanentRedirect` if the condition is met, followed by raising an `Http404` exception. The second code sample also includes part of another function `_build_app_dict`, which is not present in the first sample.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because while both samples share the same initial structure and purpose, the second sample includes additional logic with a redirect response and involves a slightly different handling of request paths, making them functionally different.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is responsible for working out renamed fields within the context of Django database migrations. It iterates over the new field keys that are not present in the old field keys, obtaining the old model name if it has been renamed, and looking up the corresponding model in the new state. It also scans to determine if a field is indeed a rename. The code sample contains additional lines dealing with initializing `renamed_fields`, handling model lookups based on renaming. The lines of code sample 2 are a subset of those in code sample 1, where it does perform similar logic but skips some of the lines that initialize `renamed_fields` and handle states.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because the second sample is syntactically similar with added, modified, or removed statements compared to the first. It contains portions of the logic but omits the initialization and some contextual code.\"}"

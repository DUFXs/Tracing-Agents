    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function '_TR56' that helps to replace instances of 'f**2' with 'h(g**2)' under specific conditions. It includes checks for the exponent being an integer, nonnegative, and within a maximum value before performing the replacement. It also defines a secondary function '_f' which contains the core logic of this replacement process. Additionally, it has a function 'TR5' that seems to provide another transformation for sine squared. The code in code sample 2 appears to be a snippet that expands on a conditional check for 'rv' to ensure it is a power and modifies the conditions regarding the exponent, such that it checks if the exponent is real or negative. It does not provide a full function but rather seems like a part of the logic from the first sample.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 is a complete function with specific logic for checking and replacing exponents, while code sample 2 includes modified conditions but is not directly comparable as it is a fragment and not functionally complete like the first.\"}"

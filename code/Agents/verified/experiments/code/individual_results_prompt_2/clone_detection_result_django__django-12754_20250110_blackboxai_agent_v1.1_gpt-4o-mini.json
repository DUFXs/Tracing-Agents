    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is determining dependencies between models in a Django application, especially focusing on the inheritance structure of models and identifying fields from parent models. The code checks if a base model has been changed, aligns dependencies based on those changes, and prepares to handle primary keys relations. In contrast, code sample 2 also deals with model dependencies but adds the handling of removed fields in relation to changes between the old and new model states. It identifies fields that exist in the old base model but have been removed in the new base model before appending relevant dependencies. Both snippets involve dependency management for models in a Django context but with different scopes.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes within dependency tracking and have distinct functionality, making them syntactically dissimilar and functionally different.\"}"

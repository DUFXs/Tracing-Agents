    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method `catch_all_view` that handles URLs, checks if the URL ends with a slash (/) based on the `APPEND_SLASH` setting, and resolves the URL. If the URL does not end with a slash and should, it performs a permanent redirect. Additionally, it defines a method `_build_app_dict` to build a dictionary of apps. In code sample 2, the method `catch_all_view` is similar but uses string formatting for URL resolution and redirection, while also omitting part of the docstring from `_build_app_dict`. The two samples share functional logic but differ in specifics regarding string formatting.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have differences in how they resolve the URL and return the redirect. They also contain some changes in layout and missing documentation.\"}"

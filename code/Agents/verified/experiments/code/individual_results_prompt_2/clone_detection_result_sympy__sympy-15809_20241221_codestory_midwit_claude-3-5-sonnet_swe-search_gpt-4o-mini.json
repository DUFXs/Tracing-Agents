It also handles the return of appropriate infinity values based on the function called. The code in code sample 2 contains a portion of code related to the class MinMaxBase, which extends functionality from the Expr and LatticeOp classes and implements a method that processes its arguments for the operations it represents, although it is incomplete. It does not contain the tests or comments found in code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve completely different purposes: one is a testing script, and the other defines class behavior without any testing elements.\"}"

Each term is solved by calling\ndiop_solve(). (Although it is possible to call diop_solve()\n     directly, one must be careful to pass an equation in the correct\nform and to interpret the output correctly; diophantine() is\n     the public-facing function to use in general.)\n \nOutput of diophantine() is a set of tuples. The elements of the\n     tuple are the solutions for each variable in the equation and\n     are arranged according to the alphabetic ordering of the variables.\ne.g. For an equation with two variables, a and b, the first\nelement of the tuple is the solution for a and the second for b.\n \n     Usage\n     =====\n \ndiophantine(eq, t, syms): Solve the diophantine\nequation eq.\nt is the optional parameter to be used by diop_solve().\nsyms is an optional list of symbols which determines the\n     order of the elements in the returned tuple.\n \nBy default, only the base solution is returned. If permute is set to\n     True then permutations of the base solution and/or permutations of the\n     signs of the values will be returned when applicable.\n \n     Details\n     =======\n \neq should be an expression which is assumed to be zero.\nt is the parameter to be used in the solution.\n \n     Examples\n     ========\n \n     >>> diophantine(x*(2*x + 3*y - z))\n     {(0, n1, n2), (t_0, t_1, 2*t_0 + 3*t_1)}\n\n     >>> diophantine(x**2 + 3*x*y + 4*x)\n     {(0, n1), (3*t_0 - 4, -t_0)}\n \n     sympy.utilities.iterables.permute_signs\n     sympy.utilities.iterables.signed_permutations\n     \"\"\"\n     from sympy.utilities.iterables import (\n         subsets, permute_signs, signed_permutations)\n \n             if syms != var:\n                 dict_sym_index = dict(zip(syms, range(len(syms))))\n                 return {tuple([t[dict_sym_index[i]] for i in var])\nfor t in diophantine(eq, param, permute=permute)}\n         n, d = eq.as_numer_denom()\n         if n.is_number:\n             return set()\n             else:\n                 final_soln.add(sol)\n         else:\nfinal_soln.add(sol)\n     return final_soln\n \n \n\n def merge_solution(var, var_t, solution):\n     \"\"\"\n     This is used to construct the full solution from the solutions of sub\n",

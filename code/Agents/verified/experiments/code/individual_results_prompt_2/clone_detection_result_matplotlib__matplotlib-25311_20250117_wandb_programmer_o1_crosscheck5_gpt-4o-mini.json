    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines methods that deal with pickling in a class, managing the state of an object when it is being serialized and deserialized, and providing functionality for draggable elements in a matplotlib figure. The method finalize_offset is defined but does nothing; __getstate__ manages the object's state during pickling, and __setstate__ updates the object's state after unpickling. Additionally, there's a DraggableOffsetBox class introduced. The code sample 2, on the other hand, includes a part of the class dealing with handling events when an object is picked in a figure, specifically ensuring that the artist is pickable, managing callbacks on button release, and processing motion events to update the position of draggable objects. It defines a property to maintain picklability. While both samples belong to the same module and are related to draggable objects in matplotlib, they serve different purposes and implement different functionalities, showing some disparate logical operations.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they implement different methods that, although both relate to the management of draggable objects in matplotlib, serve separate functionalities with different code structures and logic.\"}"

Code sample 2 appears to define parts of the 'RepeatedKFold' class and perhaps a method related to its parameters, but it does not include complete definitions for the classes stated in sample 1. Instead, it focuses on getting the number of splits and incorporates handling warnings related to deprecated parameters.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they differ significantly in context and functionality. Code sample 1 offers a broader implementation with complete class definitions, while code sample 2 only fragments of class implementation with different logical intentions.\"}"

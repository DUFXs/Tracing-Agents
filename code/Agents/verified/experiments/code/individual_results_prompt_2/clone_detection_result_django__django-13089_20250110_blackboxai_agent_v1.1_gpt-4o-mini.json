    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 executes a SQL command to remove cache entries that have a cache key lower than a certain threshold, specified by the variable `cull_num`, and retrieves the result of the fetching operation. The operation is carried out with the help of a database cursor, and it also includes a definition for a method called `clear()` that identifies the database to be used for cache management. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 performs a similar function of executing a SQL command to delete cache entries based on a cache key, but it uses a different variable name `last_cache_key` instead of `result`, and it has slight differences in spacing and formatting. Both samples define the same method `clear()`.\",\"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-2\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are identical in function but differ in variable names (such as `last_cache_key` and `result`), whitespace, and layout.\"}"

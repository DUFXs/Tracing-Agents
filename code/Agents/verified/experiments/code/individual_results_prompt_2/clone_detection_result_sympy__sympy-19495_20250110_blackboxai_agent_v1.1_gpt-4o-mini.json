    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a patch that modifies a file in the sympy library, focusing on the replacement of variables in a condition and base set related to 'ConditionSet'. It contains the logic for substituting an old symbol with a new one while checking conditions. The code handles situations where substitutions can change the original behavior depending on the input conditions. Conversely, code sample 2 also relates to 'ConditionSet' and includes examples but is primarily focused on the definition of a new method and logic for handling conditions and base sets. It involves a more extensive explanation of the substitution logic with examples and context. Although bothsamples include elements of handling conditions in 'ConditionSet', they are not directly comparable as clones due to differing structures and purposes.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 contains specific substitution logic and conditions, while code sample 2 provides various examples and explains the behavior of 'ConditionSet', including additional methods and unused variables.\"}"

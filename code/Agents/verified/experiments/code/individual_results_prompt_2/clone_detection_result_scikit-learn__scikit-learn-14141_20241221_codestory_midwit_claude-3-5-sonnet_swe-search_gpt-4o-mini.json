Meanwhile, code sample 2 only includes a part of the contents of 'sklearn/utils/_show_versions.py', showing a list of libraries followed by a function definition, and does not include any information about 'reproduce_error.py'.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 introduces a new file and contains a function call which is not present in code sample 2. They are different both in terms of content and functionality; thus, they do not match any clone definitions.\"}"

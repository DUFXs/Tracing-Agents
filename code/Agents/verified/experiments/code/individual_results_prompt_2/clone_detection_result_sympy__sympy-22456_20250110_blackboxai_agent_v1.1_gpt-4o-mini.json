    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 provides a Git patch that includes a .gitignore file and a portion of code from the sympy/codegen/ast.py file. The .gitignore file specifies patterns for files to be ignored by Git, and the code snippet from ast.py outlines class-level attributes with the __slots__ syntax and some class declarations. Meanwhile, the code in code sample 2 is a more extensive section of sympy/codegen/ast.py that imports various modules from the sympy library, defines multiple classes such as BreakToken and String, and includes methods and properties for these classes. It also showcases error handling with a method returning kwargs and discusses functionality related to string representations.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes; code sample 1 is about Git patching and some declarations, while code sample 2 contains a more comprehensive development of classes and functionality related to a symbolic mathematics library, which are not syntactically or functionally similar.\"}"

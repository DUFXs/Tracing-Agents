    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function 'test_request' which tests HTTP methods by making requests to 'http://httpbin.org/get' using the requests library in Python. It includes handling for different types of method representations including normal strings, bytes, and unicode strings. Additionally, it reports success or errors encountered during the requests. The code sample also initializes a list of methods and calls 'test_request' on each of them. In contrast, code sample 2 appears to be a snippet from a different part of the 'requests' library that deals with methods of request handling and checks if the method is of type bytes, converting it into a string if necessary. This code snippet is part of the internal mechanics related to request creation rather than testing requests as in sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 is primarily focused on testing HTTP methods using a defined function, whereas code sample 2 discusses handling request method types in a different context within the requests library, leading to significant differences in purpose and functionality.\"}"

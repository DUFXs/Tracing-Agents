    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 handles the outcome of a test case based on certain conditions, such as whether the test was expected to fail and whether it encountered an exception. It assigns various outcomes (like 'failed' or 'skipped') to the 'rep' object based on the state of the test. The code sample also includes a test function that uses the pytest framework to test skipping functionality. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 deals with different conditions regarding the test's result, specifically when the outcome should be marked as 'passed' and includes checks on whether the report was skipped. It does not handle exceptions or expected failure conditions like in sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different logical purposes and handle distinct conditions in the test outcome evaluation.\"}"

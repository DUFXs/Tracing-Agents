    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 shows a dictionary structure where several paths are being processed, and a nested loop is set up to manage post-processing of files. The main operations include creating a mapping of paths and iterating over a maximum range to handle substitutions. In contrast, code sample 2 also deals with a dictionary for processed adjustable paths, but it focuses on the assignment of processed adjustable paths rather than post-processing. Both samples contain similar lines of code, including the manipulation of `paths` and the handling of `substitutions`, but they have some differences in how the paths are approached. However, the similarities in structure and functionality suggest that they are clones. However, they differ significantly in the operations they are performing, thus making them functionally equivalent but not structurally identical. The functional focus is slightly different, indicating a type-4 clone classification.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-4\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-4 clones because they are syntactically dissimilar but functionally equivalent, each handling paths and substitutions in their respective contexts.\"}"

Both samples exhibit sections of usage around class member visibility and documentation handling.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they differ significantly in context; code sample 1 focuses on a specific user-defined behavior regarding documentation inheritance, while code sample 2 contains more general utility functions and checks without a direct correlation in function.\"}"

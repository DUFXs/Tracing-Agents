    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains a method '__eq__' that checks if two instances of 'ModelChoiceIteratorValue' are equal based on their 'value', and a method '__hash__' that returns the hash of the 'value'. It suggests the implementation of a value comparison in a model choice iterator. The code in code sample 2 includes the implementation of a method '__str__' that converts the 'value' to a string, and also includes the definition of the '__hash__' method and a partial implementation of the '__eq__' method for comparing two objects. Both samples are part of class methods dealing with value checking. However, they exhibit differences in their method names and structure.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they implement different methods of the same class and have different functionalities even though they share some common methods like '__hash__'.\"}"

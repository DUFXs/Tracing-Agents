    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a script that tests subsitutions in symbolic expressions using SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics, and prints both the original expression and its LaTeX output. It includes cases for single terms, function expressions, and complex expressions involving substitutions. The code in code sample 2 is a portion of the LaTeX printing function, specifically handling how latex expressions are formatted for display, including joining latex subs with certain formatting. It also has a method for printing integrals. Neither code sample directly contemplates identical functionalities and the second sample does not include any complete function definitions or full logic. Therefore, they serve different purposes, with the first being a full script for testing and the second being a helper function in a larger context.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 is focused on testing symbolic substitutions in expressions, while code sample 2 is primarily concerned with the formatting of output latex expressions and lacks full context.\"}"

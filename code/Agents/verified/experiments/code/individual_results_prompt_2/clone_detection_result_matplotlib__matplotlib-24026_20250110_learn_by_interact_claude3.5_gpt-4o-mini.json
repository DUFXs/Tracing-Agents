    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is focusing on stacking arrays of data and filling the area between the stacked arrays with colors. It processes input data, uses colors to fill these areas, and returns the concerted results. In contrast, code sample 2 also deals with stacking arrays but incorporates the use of an itertools cycle for colors and modifies how colors are retrieved with a slightly different structure. Both codes have similar purposes and functionalities, but differ in their implementation details.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they exhibit structural similarities while having differences in implementation details such as the usage of color assignment and the way colors are cycled through. They achieve similar end goals but with variations in method and syntax.\"}"

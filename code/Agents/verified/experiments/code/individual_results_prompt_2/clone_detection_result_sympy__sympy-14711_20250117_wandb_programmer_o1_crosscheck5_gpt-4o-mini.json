    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method __add__ for a Vector class in Python, allowing two vectors to be added together. It checks if 'other' is zero, returning 'self' if true, otherwise it checks and merges the arguments of the two vectors. It also contains a test script to verify the correct functionality of the Vector addition by attempting a summation of vectors. The code in code sample 2 only includes the definition of the __add__ method and is nearly identical to the method defined in code sample 1, lacking any references to the testing script.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for whitespace and layout differences.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks if an extension's version is 'unknown version' or if the required version is greater than the extension's version, raising a VersionRequirementError if either condition is met. It also includes metadata about the extension's parallel execution capabilities. In contrast, code sample 2 performs a similar check but uses a different method to determine if the requirement is fulfilled, involving a boolean variable and handling 'InvalidVersion'. It also raises a VersionRequirementError under certain conditions. Both samples have similar objectives but differ in implementation specifics.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because, while they are syntactically similar and serve the same functionality, they contain added and modified statements, particularly in how version validation is structured.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function 'flush' that checks if the output stream '_out' has a 'flush' method and calls it, thus ensuring that the underlying output stream is flushed if possible. It also includes a partial definition of the 'BaseCommand' class. The code in code sample 2 defines another method '__getattr__' that attempts to retrieve attributes from the output stream '_out', and also has the 'flush' method (similar to the one in sample 1), but follows it with another method 'isatty' that checks if '_out' is a terminal. Both samples appear to deal with an object that has an output stream and contain a 'flush' method as part of their functionality.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because while both contain similar functionality ('flush'), they also contain entirely different method definitions ('__getattr__' in sample 2 and a class definition in sample 1) which makes them syntactically dissimilar; hence they do not fall into any clone category.\"}"

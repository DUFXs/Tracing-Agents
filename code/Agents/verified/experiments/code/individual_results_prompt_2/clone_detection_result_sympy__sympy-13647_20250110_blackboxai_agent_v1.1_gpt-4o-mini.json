The code in code sample 2 contains only the Python code segment that retrieves matrix entries. It is taken from a single file, 'sympy/matrices/common.py', and appears to be identical to the corresponding segment in code sample 1. However, code sample 1 includes additional context (the .gitignore entry) that is not present in code sample 2.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because the Python code segments in both samples are identical except for the additional context in code sample 1. The only difference is the surrounding file structure and context, which does not affect the core code itself.\"}"

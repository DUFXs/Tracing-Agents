    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains several tests related to Django models and how fields are used within dictionaries. It sets up Django with minimal configurations, creates two models (Book and Magazine) using a field, and performs multiple assertions to test dictionary functionality with model fields. In contrast, code sample 2 only consists of a portion of a method's implementation from the Django framework, which shows how the class handles hashing and deep copying. This sample does not include any specific logic or tests related to dictionaries or model behavior.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 is focused on test functionality within the Django framework while code sample 2 is an incomplete segment of the framework, lacking any test structure or related context.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 implements methods for the `Field` class in Django, specifically the comparison methods `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__hash__`, and `__deepcopy__`. The `__eq__` method compares two `Field` instances based on their models and creation counters. The `__lt__` method establishes a comparison for ordering `Field` instances, first by their creation counters and then lexicographically by their model information if needed. The `__hash__` method generates a hash value based on the creation counter and model details. The `__deepcopy__` method is implemented but not extensively defined, indicating that not much needs to be deep-copied. On the other hand, code sample 2 also defines similar methods for the `Field` class, including a comparison `__eq__` method that checks if two fields are the same based on their creation counter and model attributes, an ordering method `__lt__`, and a `__hash__` method that hashes these attributes. However, it includes additional comments and slightly varied details in the logic. The differences are mainly in the comments, whitespace, and some of the internal logic structure, but fundamentally, they perform the same operations.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-2\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are functionally identical except for variations in comments, some identifier function details, whitespace, and layout.\"}"

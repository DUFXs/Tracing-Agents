    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a procedure for modifying the `resulting_indices` list based on the position of free gamma matrices. It specifically handles a case where `first_dum_pos` is greater than zero, iterating in reverse to insert elements into `resulting_indices`. The last line initializes `resulting_expr` as `S.Zero`. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 processes the `resulting_indices` list differently by creating it as a list of combined elements from `free_pos` and then processes it in a single statement. It also initializes `resulting_expr` as `S.Zero` after manipulating `resulting_indices`.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they have different logic for handling `resulting_indices` and utilize different approaches for iteration and element insertion. The fundamental operations and their arrangements differ fundamentally, indicating that the samples are not even functionally equivalent.\"}"

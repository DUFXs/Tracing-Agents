It also features a script in 'reproduce_error.py' that attempts to create instances of these aggregates while handling potential TypeErrors. The code in code sample 2 includes the same definitions for the Avg, Sum, and other classes but omits the script from 'reproduce_error.py'.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except the first sample contains additional code in 'reproduce_error.py', and the whitespaces or layout differences do not affect their equivalence.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 computes a summation of boolean values from a collection of children to determine if an odd number of those values is true. It uses a modulo operation to check if the sum is odd. Specifically, it creates a sum expression of the count of true children and checks if that sum is equal to 1 after applying modulo 2. The result is returned in some SQL format. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 performs a similar check but includes additional logic by creating a left-hand side expression (lhs) from the children, applying a logical OR operation, and modifying the sum calculation with a `Mod` function. It effectively checks the same condition but is more complex as indicated by the extra logic and restructuring of how it checks for the results. Hence, both pieces of code aim to implement an XOR-like behavior for collections of boolean conditions but in different ways.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 2 introduces new logic (logical OR and an additional check with 'Mod') that changes the structure and functionality of the code compared to code sample 1.\"}"

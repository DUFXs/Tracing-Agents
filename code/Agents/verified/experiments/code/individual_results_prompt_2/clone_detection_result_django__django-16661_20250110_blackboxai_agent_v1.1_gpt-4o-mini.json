Code sample 2 similarly checks for field relationships but has slight variations in conditions related to field comparison and management of the relational logic. It specifically checks if fields are relations and whether they exist in certain parent or auto_field attributes before appending to 'relation_parts'.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they show syntactical similarities with added, modified, or removed statements, specifically in how conditions are checked and how 'relation_parts' is handled, demonstrating functional similarities despite differing formulations.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 imports several components from the SymPy library, defines two symbols 'x' and 'y', and contains a series of print statements that test the behavior of the 'Contains' class with different sets and intervals, showcasing how to use the 'Contains.as_set()' method. Code sample 2 contains a fragment from the implementation of the 'as_set' method itself, which returns the second argument of the 'Contains' class, indicating the set against which membership is being tested. Essentially, code sample 1 focuses on testing the functionality of 'Contains', while code sample 2 provides a piece of its implementation.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 is a testing script that calls methods from the 'Contains' class, while code sample 2 is a snippet from the actual method definition in the 'Contains' class. Therefore, they serve different purposes and are not similar in structure or intent.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is primarily focused on a model choice iterator for Django forms, which includes a method to check equality between instances and the ability to hash them. It also includes some code for testing the functionality of this iterator with a dictionary. Code sample 2 focuses on another method, __str__, which converts the object representation to a string and checks for equality between instances. Both code samples are dealing with the same class functionalities, specifically concerning equality checks and string representations. However, they contain different methods and serve different purposes within the class context.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they implement different methods within the same class but do not show any similarity in terms of structure or implementation other than the shared class context.\"}"

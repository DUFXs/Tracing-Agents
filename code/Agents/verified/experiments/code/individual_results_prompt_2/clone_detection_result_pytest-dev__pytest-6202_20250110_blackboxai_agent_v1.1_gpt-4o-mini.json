    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 performs operations on a list of parts by reversing the list and then joining its elements into a string separated by dots. It also includes a method named reportinfo which contains a comment about caching. The code in code sample 2 is similar as it also contains the list operations for parts, reverses the list, and joins them into a string using a dot. It also includes the method reportinfo with the same comment about caching.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-2\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are identical except for minor differences in whitespace and layout. The literal values (like the dot separator in return statement) are represented differently (as a string in code sample 2) but are functionally the same. The structure and logic are consistent across both samples.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 includes an example of using the Permutation class from the sympy library to create permutations and print results, as well as raising a ValueError when the input causes issues related to cycles or duplicates. Code sample 2, on the other hand, contains a snippet that checks for duplicates in the arguments and raises a ValueError if they are found, but does not include any instantiation of the Permutation class or print statements. It seems to be part of the implementation logic in the Permutation class for handling input validation.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because sample 1 is an example of usage while sample 2 is an implementation detail of the Permutation class, and they serve different purposes in the codebase.\"}"

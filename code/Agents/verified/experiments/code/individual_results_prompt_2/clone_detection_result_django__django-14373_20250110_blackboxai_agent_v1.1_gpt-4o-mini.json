The relevant return statement formats the year to include leading zeros. In code sample 2, the method 'Y' also returns the year in a four-digit format but uses a different string formatting method ('%04d') instead of f-strings. It also includes a similar method 'z' that provides the same functionality. Both samples contain comments explaining the purpose of the methods.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar with modifications to the string formatting and method implementations.\"}"

If the number of support vectors (n_SV) is zero, it assigns an empty matrix to self.dual_coef_. If n_SV is not zero, it calculates dual_coef_indices and dual_coef_indptr, then creates a sparse matrix for dual coefficients. Finally, it defines the predict method for performing regression on input samples X. In code sample 2, the logic is similar, but it uses a different conditional check ('if not n_SV') to handle the case of zero support vectors and has minor ordering differences in the statements. Both methods ultimately achieve the same functionality.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but contain different statements and rewriting of conditions.\"}"

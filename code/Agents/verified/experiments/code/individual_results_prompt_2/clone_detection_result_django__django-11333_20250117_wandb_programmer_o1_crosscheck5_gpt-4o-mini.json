    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a couple of functions to manage URL resolvers in a Django application, specifically using caching to optimize resolver retrieval. It includes the main functions for obtaining resolvers as well as caching features. The code also mentions the use of print statements to trace the behavior of the resolvers created in the context of a test. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 also deals with URL resolution but focuses on clearing caches related to resolvers, referencing functions like `get_ns_resolver` and `_get_cached_resolver`. It sets up a function `clear_url_caches` that clears the caches of these resolver functions, without the broader context of the main testing method. The two samples share similar methods for resolving URLs but are used in different contexts and with different functionalities.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes. Code sample 1 involves retrieving and working with URL resolvers with a testing context, while code sample 2 is specifically about clearing caches related to URL resolvers. The structure and intent of the code differ even though there's overlapping functionality.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a function that processes a string by trimming wrapping punctuation and ensuring parentheses are balanced. It modifies the string based on certain conditions and ultimately returns a tuple containing processed values. Meanwhile, the code in code sample 2 focuses on unescaping HTML entities and trimming trailing punctuation from a string, using similar logic but potentially different variable names. Both samples share similar logic concerning trailing punctuation but have differences in surrounding contexts and structure.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they do not share identical or similar structure or variable persistency. They undertake related tasks but the overall implementation, context, and syntax differ enough to classify them as dissimilar.\"}"

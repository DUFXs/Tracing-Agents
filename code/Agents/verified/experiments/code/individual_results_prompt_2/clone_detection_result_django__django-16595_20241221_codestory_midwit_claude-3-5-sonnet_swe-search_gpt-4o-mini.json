    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a series of migration operations in Django for altering a model field, specifically the 'title' field of a 'book' model. It sets up an optimizer to improve how these operations are processed and prints out the original and optimized operation counts. The code in code sample 2 is a fragment of a migration operation in Django that handles the reduction of field operations based on conditions, returning the operation if it's the same as what was previously defined. It involves operations like altering or removing fields but does not provide a complete context as it is a partial snippet.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes and contexts within Django migrations. Sample 1 is about creating and optimizing operations, while Sample 2 deals with reducing field operations. They are significantly different in structure and functionality.\"}"

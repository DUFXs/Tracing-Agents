    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a class called MinMaxBase that inherits from Expr and LatticeOp. Inside the class, it implements a method __new__ that takes a variable number of arguments and assumptions. If no arguments are provided, it returns the identity of the class. Otherwise, it converts the provided arguments to symbolic expressions using the sympify function. The code sample 2 also defines the same class and method, but it omits the conditional check for empty arguments and the return statement for cls.identity. Both snippets share a common structure, but code sample 2 is slightly modified by removing a part of the original logic.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar, but code sample 2 has removed the logic that checks for empty arguments and the return statement, making it a modified version of the original in code sample 1.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a class 'TypeSerializer' which inherits from 'BaseSerializer'. Inside the class, there is a method 'serialize' that initializes a list called 'special_cases' containing tuples with model types and their string representations. This method appears to be designed to handle serialization of certain types. The code in code sample 2 contains the same class definition and method with the same functionality. However, it has a small difference in the representation of the import string in the tuple of special_cases, changing the single quotes to double quotes. This does not change the functionality or structure. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-2\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are identical except for differences in identifier names, literal values, whitespace, layout, and comments. The only difference is the way the import string is quoted.\"}"

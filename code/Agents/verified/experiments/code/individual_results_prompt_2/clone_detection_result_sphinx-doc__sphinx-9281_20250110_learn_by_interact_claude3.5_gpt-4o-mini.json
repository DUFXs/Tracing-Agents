    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function `object_description` that provides a textual representation of various types of Python objects. It checks if the object is an instance of `enum.Enum` and formats its description accordingly. If the object is a dictionary, it attempts to sort its keys and fall back to a generic representation if sorting fails. The function returns a documentation string if none of the conditions are met. In contrast, code sample 2 continues the logic for the `object_description` function by handling additional types such as sets and frozensets, also trying to sort them when necessary and providing a formatted representation. While both code samples involve the same function and similar logic, they focus on different types of objects with sample 2 being an extension of sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they represent different parts of a function implementation. Code sample 2 is an extension of code sample 1, handling more object types and therefore introduces additional statements and logic, classifying them as distinct implementations rather than clones.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is a patch that includes the modification of a file related to testing data for pytest, along with the function from 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py' that processes some hyperbolic functions. Specifically, it handles a case involving the 'coth' function based on a variable 'm'. On the other hand, code sample 2 includes only the portion from 'sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py' without the surrounding context of the '.gitignore' changes. The hyperbolic function logic is exactly the same in both samples.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in functionality and content except for the additional context in the first sample regarding the '.gitignore' patch.\"}"

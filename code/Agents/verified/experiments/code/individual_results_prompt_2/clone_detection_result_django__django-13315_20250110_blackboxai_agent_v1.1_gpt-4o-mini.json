    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks whether a form field has a queryset and a method to get limit choices. If so, it retrieves the limit choices and applies them to the queryset using Django's complex filter to avoid duplicates. The code then updates the form field's queryset to be distinct. In code sample 2, the code implements a similar functionality by defining a function to apply limit choices to the form field's queryset. It checks for the queryset and the get_limit_choices_to method, retrieves limit choices, and constructs a filter using Django's Exists and OuterRef to ensure no duplicates are returned. Although both codes deal with applying limit choices to querysets, they use different methods and structures to achieve similar tasks.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar in structure and functionality but differ in how statements are constructed and the methods used.\"}"

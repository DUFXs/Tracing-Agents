It also includes a prefix addition method for form fields. The code in code sample 2 is a snippet from the same file and seems to be part of a larger block that checks conditions under which a deletion field should be added to the form, but it is incomplete and lacks the contextual placement seen in code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace and layout.

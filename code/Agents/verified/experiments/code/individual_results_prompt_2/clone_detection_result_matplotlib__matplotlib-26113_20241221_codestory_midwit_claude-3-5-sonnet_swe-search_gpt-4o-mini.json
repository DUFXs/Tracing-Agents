    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains a patch indicating changes to a Python script related to matplotlib, where it checks if 'mincnt' is None and assigns it a value of 0 if it is. It then constructs a NumPy array from a list comprehension that applies 'reduce_C_function' to elements if they meet a certain condition. The code in code sample 2 is practically identical but is represented without the index change information at the beginning. Both samples perform the same operations in an identical manner.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace and layout, specifically the additional patch metadata in code sample 1 that is not present in code sample 2.\"}"

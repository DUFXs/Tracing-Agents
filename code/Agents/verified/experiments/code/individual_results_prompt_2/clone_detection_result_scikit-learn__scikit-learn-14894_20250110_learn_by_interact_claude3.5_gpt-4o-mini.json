    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 initializes a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model using various parameters and fits it with training data represented as a sparse matrix. It also handles the case of having no support vectors by initializing the dual coefficients properly. Meanwhile, the code in code sample 2 focuses on handling the dual coefficient calculations in a modified way, particularly checking for the presence of support vectors and assigning an empty sparse matrix if none exist. It also defines the predict method for the SVR model for performing regression on input samples.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because, although they handle support vectors differently, they have a similar overall structure and logic that represent syntactical similarities with modifications in some statements.\"}"

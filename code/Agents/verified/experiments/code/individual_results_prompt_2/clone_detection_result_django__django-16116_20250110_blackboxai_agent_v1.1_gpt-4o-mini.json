    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 appears to be part of a command-line interface for managing Django migrations, specifically dealing with raising a CommandError when a migration name is not a valid Python identifier. It also deals with various options related to making migrations. Code sample 2 is more focused on parsing command-line arguments for the same purpose of making migrations, including options like --check for checking for changes and --scriptable for script behavior, as well as handling the logical flow of checking and writing migration files based on the options provided. Both samples relate to the same functionality in migration management but handle it differently.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different aspects of the migration management functionality in Django, with one focused on raising errors and the other focused on parsing arguments and writing migration files.\"}"

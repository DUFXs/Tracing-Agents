    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a function that handles the conversion of a width value (dx) in relation to an initial value (x0) and a conversion method (convert). It includes logic to manage cases where the conversion might lead to exceptions, such as when dealing with empty arrays or incompatible types. The function asserts the type of the conversion variable and handles exceptions to ensure a smooth fallback mechanism when expected values aren\u2019t available. In short, it aims to make width conversion flexible and robust against various inputs. The code in code sample 2 appears to be a continuation and modification of the error handling sections, specifically dealing with cases when there are no finite elements found during safe conversions. It uses different function names and structure in similar logic for obtaining finite elements, thus indicating adjustments to improve the handling of such situations. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they perform similar tasks but have differences in the identifiers used (e.g., 'cbook._safe_first_finite' vs. 'cbook.safe_first_element'), which classifies them as functionally different despite somewhat similar logic.\"}"

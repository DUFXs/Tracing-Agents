    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 performs a 1D k-means clustering procedure using the KMeans function, sorts the cluster centers to ensure they are in monotonic order, and calculates the bin edges based on these sorted centers. It also combines the minimum and maximum column values with the computed bin edges. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 does a similar clustering operation, centers the output, and sorts the centers directly to ensure they are in the correct order, but without a comment explaining the sorting necessity. Both samples ultimately compute the same bin edges based on similar logic.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they exhibit syntactical similarity but differ in comments and contain a slight alteration in how the centers are sorted, with code sample 1 explicitly sorting with `np.sort(centers)` and code sample 2 using `centers.sort()`.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a function that processes a spectrum using a window and normalizes it to compensate for windowing effects. It performs operations on the spectral data based on the mode, including computing the power spectrum and normalizing by the sum of the window. The code sample also generates a time vector for spectral analysis. Meanwhile, code sample 2 provides additional conditional checks (like modes for 'psd', 'magnitude', etc.) that further refine how the spectrum is computed and how the windowing is applied, ensuring accurate power preservation. It also includes operations on the result variable for various modes, indicating it is part of the same spectral processing routine but focuses more on the input and handling based on different conditions.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 focuses on the processing of a flat top window and subsequent spectral analysis, whereas code sample 2 includes additional conditions and logic related to the various modes ('psd', 'magnitude', etc.). They are both related to processing a spectrum, but their syntaxes and operational flows are different enough to categorize them as distinct pieces of code. Thus, there is no direct clone relationship.\"}"

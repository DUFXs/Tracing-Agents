    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains portions of a Python module related to testing certain set operations (specifically with Contains and its method as_set). It has function definitions and asserts to check functionality, including a main function that conducts tests. The code mainly discusses the implementation of these functionalities and how they handle exceptions during various operations. The second code sample, on the other hand, presents a small portion of the same module, specifically the definition of the method as_set, but it omits the context, comments, and any associated functionality that was present in the first code sample. Essentially, it is the definition of the method as_set without any surrounding code or comments, significantly simplifying the content., \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they consist of an identical function definition with respect to whitespace and comments. The actual method as_set is implemented in both samples, and differences mainly pertain to whitespace and layout.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 implements the unapplying of a database migration within the Django framework. It checks if a migration is not being faked, acquires a schema editor, and calls the migration's unapply method to revert changes. It handles replacement migrations by recording both the individual migrated states and the main migration as unapplied, reporting progress via a callback. The code sample is part of a larger script that likely deals with migration operations. The code in code sample 2 contains a subset of the logic from code sample 1, handling unapplying migrations, noting replacement migrations, and reporting progress. However, it is a shorter and incomplete segment focused primarily on migration management.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they exhibit identical structure and behavior, differing only in whitespace, layout, and comments.\"}"

The first function call clears the cache for all models, while the second clears the cache for swappable settings. In code sample 2, the purpose is similar, as it also calls the same two methods for clearing caches. However, it has additional comments about its usage in tests. Overall, both snippets deal with cache management, focusing on clearing different caches to prevent stale data, but they have different comments and formatting.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but contain some differences in context, layout, and additional comments.\"}"

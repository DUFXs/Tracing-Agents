    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is an empty patch, indicating that it contains no code changes or modifications. In contrast, code sample 2 includes a Python patch that modifies a schema file in Django by implementing two main functionalities: it creates a set of new indexes based on a tuple from `new_index_together` and manages index deletions and creations based on the comparison of old and new indexes. Specifically, it identifies which indexes were deleted and which were created, processing them accordingly.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 contains no code changes at all, while code sample 2 has actual code that performs specific behaviors related to index management in a Django application.\"}"

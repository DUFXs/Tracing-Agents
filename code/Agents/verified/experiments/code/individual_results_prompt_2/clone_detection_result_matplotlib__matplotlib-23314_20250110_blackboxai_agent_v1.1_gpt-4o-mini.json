    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is a patch related to a file in a repository, specifically for 'lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py', defining a method 'draw' that uses the 'renderer' parameter. It includes operations to check visibility, unstale a view, and draw a background patch. The patch includes some file changes marked by indexes and also appears to modify a '.gitignore' file. The code in code sample 2 is a similar patch for the same 'draw' method from the same file, doing essentially the same operations, though it does not include any references to other files or changes in the patch details. Both patches include the same method structure and functionality.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace and layout.\"}"

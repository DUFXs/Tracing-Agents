It includes a comment or documentation about the expected type for a Tuple and mentions the creation of a Request object. The focus is on defining the structure of some request management. In contrast, code sample 2 includes import statements for various modules and a similar comment about a Tuple type, but it also does additional imports from other modules and components, indicating it is preparing the scope for further functionality within the 'requests' library.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 mainly deals with a patch for specific files with limited content, while code sample 2 includes a broader range of import statements and serves a different structural purpose, leading to significant functional differences despite a similar comment appearing in both.\"}"

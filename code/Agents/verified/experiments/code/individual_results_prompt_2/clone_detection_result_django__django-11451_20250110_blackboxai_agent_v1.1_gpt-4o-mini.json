    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines an 'authenticate' function that checks whether a username and password are provided. If the username is None, it tries to set it from the 'kwargs'. If either username or password is still None, it returns None. After that, it attempts to retrieve the user using the given username. The code in code sample 2 is similar, as it contains the same 'authenticate' function with the same logic; however, instead of returning None when the username or password is missing, it simply uses 'return', which can be interpreted as returning None implicitly in Python. Both patches indicate a potential change in a Django authentication backend, specifically where user authentication is processed. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar with one statement modified (returning None explicitly vs. returning without a value), while the overall structure and logic of the function remain consistent.\"}"

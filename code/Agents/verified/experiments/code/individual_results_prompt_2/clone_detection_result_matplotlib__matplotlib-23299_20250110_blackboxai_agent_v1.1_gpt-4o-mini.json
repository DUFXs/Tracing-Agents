    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 outlines the usage of a context manager for setting Matplotlib's rc parameters, obtaining the original backend settings, and provides a mechanism to return to those settings. It defines functions like 'use' and 'interactive' which manage the context for backend settings. The code mentions clearing existing parameters, updating them, and checking the backend status. In contrast, code sample 2 also deals with similar functionality regarding the rc parameters, emphasizing the return of a context manager for modifying those parameters, but it has a different method to handle the rc file and backend settings. Sample 2 shows a more condensed solution for a similar goal. Overall, while they share the same theme, their structures and details are distinct enough to suggest they are not direct clones.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve similar purposes but differ significantly in their implementation and specific details.\"}"

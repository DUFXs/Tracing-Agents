    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a property method `migration_name_fragment` that returns a formatted string based on the model's name and index name. It also includes a method `reduce`, which removes an index operation if specific conditions are met, and defines a class `RemoveIndex`. In contrast, code sample 2 contains the same `migration_name_fragment` method and `reduce` method, but with differences in layout and missing comments, along with a docstring for the `RemoveIndex` class. However, the functionality remains the same between both samples but with different formatting and structure.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace, layout, and the presence of comments.\"}"

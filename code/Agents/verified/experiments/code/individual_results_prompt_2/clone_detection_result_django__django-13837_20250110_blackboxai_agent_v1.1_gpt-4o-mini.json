    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks whether Python was launched with the -m flag, gathers the arguments, and constructs the command to execute a script. It first determines if the main module has a specification and retrieves its parent package name if it exists. If the script file doesn't exist, it provides a comment about potential reasons for this on Windows. The code in code sample 2 performs similar operations, checking if the main module has a specification and using it to create the command arguments. However, it simplifies the check by directly accessing the `__main__` module instead of the `sys.modules`. Additionally, it has different comment formatting and some variations in whitespace.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have some differences in statement structure, comments, and imports that modify the original code logic.\"}"

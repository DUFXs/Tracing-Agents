    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 appears to be a part of an algorithm that processes a mapping of generators (denoted as 's') for a given group structure, likely dealing with permutation groups. It evaluates whether the generators are part of certain images, calculates powers, and handles inverses while aggregating results. The code manages the states through iterations controlled by counters (i, j) indicating positions in the input sequences. In contrast, code sample 2 defines a function (_check_homomorphism) which validates a homomorphic mapping between two abstract algebraic structures, like groups. It checks whether the mapping respects the group operations and prepares necessary structures (like identity and generators). It also contains a nested function (_image) that calculates images of elements based on their provided mappings. Both pieces of code relate to algebraic structures, but they serve different purposes: one processes mappings iteratively while the other validates homomorphisms systematically.\" \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they perform different functions in relation to group theory, where one focuses on constructing mappings and iterating through generators while the other is about validating those mappings in terms of group homomorphisms.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 includes a test case function that uses the Permutation class from the SymPy library to test various cycle configurations, checking for expected results or errors. It prints out success or failure messages based on the outcomes of these tests. Sample cases include permutations with overlapping cycles, identity results, and error handling for invalid input. The second patch within code sample 1 appears to include a partial implementation related to handling cycles and checking for duplicates among permutations. \\n\\nThe code in code sample 2 contains a patch from a different section of the same file that checks for duplicates in cycle arguments and raises a ValueError if duplicates are detected. It does not include any test cases or output functionality, but it relates to the validation of cycles being processed in permutations. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 focuses on testing and validation of cycle permutations while code sample 2 contains core logic related to checking for duplicates without any testing functionality. They serve different purposes and do not share sufficient structural or functional similarities to be considered clones.\"}"

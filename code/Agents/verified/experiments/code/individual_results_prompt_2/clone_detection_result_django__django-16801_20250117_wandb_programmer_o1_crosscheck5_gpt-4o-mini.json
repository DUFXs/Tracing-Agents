    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a Django model that connects a signal to update image dimensions after a model instance is initialized. Specifically, it checks if the model is not abstract and has width or height fields, and if so, it connects the 'post_init' signal to the 'update_dimension_fields' method. The code also defines the 'update_dimension_fields' method to update the dimensions of the image associated with the model. On the other hand, code sample 2 deals with a different aspect of the same model, handling situations where the dimensions can be forced to update. It checks if the field is deferred, and if so, it returns early without doing anything, alongside adding a comment about forcing updates but has not fully implemented that logic.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share similar structural components and functionality related to model signals and dimension updates, but code sample 2 includes additional checks and a different context, making it syntactically similar yet modified with added statements.\"}"

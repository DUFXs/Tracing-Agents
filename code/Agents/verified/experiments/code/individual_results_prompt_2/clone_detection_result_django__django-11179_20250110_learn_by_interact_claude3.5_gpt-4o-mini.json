    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 handles the deletion of instances from a Django model, optimizing for speed with the method can_fast_delete. It utilizes transactions to ensure that if an error occurs during deletion, the operation can be rolled back. After checking if fast deletion is possible and performing the deletion, it sets the primary key attribute of the instance to None and returns the count of deleted items. The code sample also handles multiple instances and uses a transaction without savepoints to delete those instances. In contrast, code sample 2 consists only of a part of the implementation related to fast deletion checking and the transaction rollback, omitting the initial setup or the large context of managing the instance deletions. This sample is a subset of the operations and context present in code sample 1.\",\"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"Both code samples are functionally the same in their implementation details regarding instance deletions, with the second sample being just a truncated version of the first, only omitting additional context like initialization and other specific parts of the logic. Therefore, they are type-1 clones as they contain identical logic with differing sizes and contexts.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a function that processes algebraic equations, specifically handling symbolic variables and conditions for remapping solutions based on the free symbols of the equation. It checks if the provided symbols are in the variables, raises errors if they are not, and remaps them if they are ordered differently. The second sample is a continuation or an extraction of code that also performs operations related to these equations, focusing on returning tuples of solutions. It references a function `diophantine` which implies there may be additional logic involved that's not shown in the second sample.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they are not closely related in structure. While they share context in handling symbolic equations, the second code sample introduces a call to a different function and lacks elements present in the first sample. Therefore, they fall into different syntactical and functional patterns.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a series of test cases for mathematical expressions using symbolic computation, specifically testing the behavior of expressions with various hyperbolic functions while handling exceptions during substitution operations. The code sample includes iterations over different mathematical expressions and captures errors if any arise during the evaluations. The code in code sample 2 defines a function that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two polynomial expressions, handling possible exceptions that may occur if the inputs are not polynomial terms. It extracts GCD terms and simplifies them, while also providing error management for polynomial-related issues.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve entirely different purposes; the first focuses on testing expressions with symbolic manipulations, while the second focuses on calculating the GCD of polynomials. They do not share structural similarities nor are they functionally equivalent.\"}"

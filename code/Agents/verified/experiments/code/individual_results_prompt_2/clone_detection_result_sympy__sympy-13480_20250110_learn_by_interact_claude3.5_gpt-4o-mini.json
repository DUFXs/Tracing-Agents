Code sample 2 contains a fragment of a function that processes arguments to calculate the hyperbolic cotangent and also includes a conditional check involving 'S.ComplexInfinity' and returns a value based on the cotangent computation. Code sample 2 doesn't define a value or a loop like code sample 1 but instead is part of a function's logic.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they are syntactically dissimilar and pertain to different functionalities in the sympy library. Code sample 1 focuses on printing results from a symbolic computation, while code sample 2 contains implementation details for the hyperbolic cotangent function.\"}"

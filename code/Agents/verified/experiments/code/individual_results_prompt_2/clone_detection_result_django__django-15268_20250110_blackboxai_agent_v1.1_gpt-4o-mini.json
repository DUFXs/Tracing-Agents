    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines two methods: `reduce` and `migration_name_fragment` within a class (presumably related to Django migrations). The `migration_name_fragment` method generates a string for naming a migration based on the model's name and an option name. The `reduce` method assesses if a particular operation can be reduced based on several logical conditions regarding the types of operations and their values. Code sample 2 also includes a method `migration_name_fragment` for generating the same migration name. However, it defines a different `reduce` method that uses a straightforward return of a super call and adds a check for `can_reduce_through`. Additionally, it defines a `can_reduce_through` method. Both samples contain the `AlterUniqueTogether` class with a docstring, but sample 2 has a second `can_reduce_through` method defined. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they contain different method implementations and additional logic, indicating they have modified functionality and are not simply variations of the same piece of code.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a new Python file, 'reproduce.py', which imports the 'symbols' and 'diophantine' functions from the 'sympy' library. It creates two symbolic variables, 'm' and 'n', and defines an equation 'eq' based on these variables. It then prints the results of the 'diophantine' function using different permutations of these symbols. The code sample 2, on the other hand, is a portion of the existing file 'diophantine.py' in the 'sympy' library. It features logic that checks if the provided symbols are different from the variable names, creates an index mapping of the symbols, and processes the input equation further. Thus, sample 1 is a script that tests the 'diophantine' functionality, while sample 2 is a part of the implementation of that functionality.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes: sample 1 is a standalone script meant for testing, while sample 2 is a portion of the actual implementation of a function within the library.\"}"

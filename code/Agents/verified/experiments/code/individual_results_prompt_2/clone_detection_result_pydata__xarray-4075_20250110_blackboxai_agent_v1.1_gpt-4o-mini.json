    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a function that handles missing values in weights by converting boolean weights to float for correct numerical operations. It checks if the `weights` data type is boolean and converts them to float if so. Additionally, it assigns `obj` and `weights` to instance variables. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 masks data values that are NaN to prevent incorrect weight calculations. It checks if the `weights` data type is boolean and then computes the sum of weights using a reduction operation, ensuring that valid weights are identified. The two code samples deal with handling weights but in different contexts with different goals.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes. The first sample focuses on converting boolean weights to float, while the second focuses on summing weights and handling NaN values. They do not share structural similarity or functionality.\"}"

In addition, it retrieves a value for `use_l10n` from internal settings. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 retrieves the value of `use_l10n` based on whether the `lang` variable is `None`, and it includes additional logic to determine language and caching based on `format_type`. Both samples are related to localization but handle different scenarios and include alterations in variables and logic.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they differ significantly in functionality, with different conditional logic and are syntactically dissimilar.\"}"

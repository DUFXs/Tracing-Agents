    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines several test cases for computing the distance between points in 2D and 3D space using the `Point` class from the `sympy.geometry` module. It includes original and edge cases demonstrating various scenarios of point dimension compatibility. The output consists of print statements that showcase the distance calculation results. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 focuses on the implementation of a distance calculation function (`taxicab_distance`) for points using a more complex logic that includes handling different lengths of point arguments, padding shorter points, and calculating the distance with either Euclidean or taxicab geometry. The overall structure and logic are different from the first code sample.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes: one is for testing distance calculations with specific cases, while the other is an implementation of a distance calculation function with distinct logic.\"}"

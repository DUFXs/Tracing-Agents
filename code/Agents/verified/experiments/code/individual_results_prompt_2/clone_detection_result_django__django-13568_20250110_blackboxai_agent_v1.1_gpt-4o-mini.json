    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks if the username field in a Django model has a unique constraint or is explicitly marked as unique. It gathers errors related to the username uniqueness check, particularly in the context of specific authentication backends. The code uses Django's model API to access the field and constraints. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 performs a similar check but validates a separate condition related to unique constraints, using a different syntax but ultimately aiming to achieve a similar effect. Thus, it checks for the uniqueness of the username field more directly without referencing the unique constraint type. Additionally, the handling of errors and the method of retrieving the field information are slightly different. The way constraints are accessed also varies between the two samples.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but differ in the structure of the checks and how certain fields are accessed, indicative of modifications in the code logic.\"}"

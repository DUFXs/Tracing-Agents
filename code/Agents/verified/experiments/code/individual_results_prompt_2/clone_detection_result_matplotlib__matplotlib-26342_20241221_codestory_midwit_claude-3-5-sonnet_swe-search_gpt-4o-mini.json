    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a class `ContourSet`, which is part of the matplotlib library for creating and manipulating contour plots. It includes a method `set_paths` to set the contour paths and manage their states. The docstring provides information about its functionality and usage parameters. In contrast, code sample 2 defines a few methods like `set_paths` and `get_paths`, which are also related to path management but do not include a class or any docstring. The methods return and set internal paths for a collection without creating a new class.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they belong to different classes (or potentially different modules) and have distinct purposes, even though they share similar method names.\"}"

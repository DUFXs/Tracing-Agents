    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains a conditional that checks whether the object is visible, and if it is not visible, it returns early. Then, it binds a draw path function for the renderer and performs operations on a path and a transform, meant possibly for rendering graphical patches in Matplotlib. In contrast, code sample 2 also includes a visibility check but adds a context manager for setting the dash pattern and binding the draw path function, which indicates a modification in the way the drawing function is prepared. While both samples share some logical structure and perform related tasks, they show more differences than just whitespace or identifier names.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because the second sample includes additional functionality and structure not present in the first sample, suggesting that they are not simply variations of the same logic.\"}"

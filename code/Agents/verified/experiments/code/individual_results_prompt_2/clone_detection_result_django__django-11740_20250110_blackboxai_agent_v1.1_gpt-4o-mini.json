    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 adds a migration operation that alters a field in a Django model, specifically checking dependencies for foreign keys if transitioning from a non-relation to a relation field. It uses a method to get the dependencies needed for these changes and adds that operation to a list. The code sample also has a comment explaining the context of changing fields. Meanwhile, the code in code sample 2 is focused on retrieving old and new field information in a different scenario, specifically handling renamed fields and ensuring dependencies are correctly managed while doing so. It still contains logic that deals with foreign keys and comments regarding model renames. Both samples deal with Django migrations, but the logic differs significantly due to handling different attributes and conditions on fields. Therefore, they are syntactically different and not identical enough to be clones.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they handle different logic related to Django migrations and have considerable differences in their structure and functionality.\"}"

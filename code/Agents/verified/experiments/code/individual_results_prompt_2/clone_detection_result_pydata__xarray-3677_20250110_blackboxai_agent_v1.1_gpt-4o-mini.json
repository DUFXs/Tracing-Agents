The code in code sample 2, however, is part of a different context, discussing conflict resolution for variable merges in a Dataset, and is checking if the 'other' parameter is a DataArray before merging. The two samples also reside in different files within the xarray library, indicating different functionalities. Thus, while they may relate to merging data, they serve different purposes.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they are not syntactically similar nor do they have similar functionalities; they are part of different processes in the xarray library's handling of datasets.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a process for using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to fit and predict on a dataset generated from a normal distribution. It sets a random seed for reproducibility, generates a dataset, and fits a GMM with and without specifying the number of initializations (n_init). It then checks that the predictions from both fittings are equal using assertions. On the other hand, code sample 2 seems to be part of the implementation of the GMM from the sklearn library, specifically dealing with convergence warnings and retrieving parameters during the fitting process. It ensures that the final labels returned by fit_predict are consistent and includes some method definitions. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they belong to different contexts; code sample 1 is an application of Gaussian Mixture Models, while code sample 2 is implementation-specific code for the Gaussian Mixture component in the sklearn library. They do not exhibit any of the cloning characteristics described.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 involves a series of operations related to handling annotations and aggregates within a Django ORM query. It checks for subqueries and window functions and prepares an aggregate by replacing expressions and storing them in the annotations dictionary. The code carefully assesses whether the query references any window functions and adjusts its behavior accordingly. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 performs similar functionality but includes a slight modification by changing one of the arguments in the logical expression regarding window functions. Specifically, it changes a 'False' value to 'True' in a part of the checking process for 'contains_over_clause'.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but show a modification in logic due to a change of a literal value in one of the lines. This indicates some alteration in the functionality while retaining overall structure.\"}"

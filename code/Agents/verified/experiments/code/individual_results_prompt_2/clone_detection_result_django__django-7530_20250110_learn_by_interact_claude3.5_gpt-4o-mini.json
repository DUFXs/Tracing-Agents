The code in code sample 2 appears to be a snippet that includes only the section related to allowing migrations for models, along with a comment stating that at least one model must be migrated to the database. Code sample 2 is effectively a shortened version of the relevant portion of code from code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in code logic but differ in the amount of surrounding code and any additional comments.\"}"

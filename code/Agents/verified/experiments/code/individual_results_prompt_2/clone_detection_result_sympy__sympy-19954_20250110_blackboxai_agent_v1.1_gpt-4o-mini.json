    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks for minimal representative blocks in a system and removes any non-minimal blocks based on certain criteria. It uses a list of indices to mark blocks for removal if they do not meet the minimality condition, and then it deletes those blocks in reverse order. Finally, if the minimal condition is satisfied, it adds the block to the list of blocks. The code in code sample 2 performs a similar functionality, but it uses a boolean mask array to mark blocks for removal instead of managing indices manually. Then it constructs new lists of blocks using this mask to filter out the non-minimal blocks.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have modified statements, such as using a boolean mask in code sample 2 instead of directly modifying the indices in code sample 1.\"}"

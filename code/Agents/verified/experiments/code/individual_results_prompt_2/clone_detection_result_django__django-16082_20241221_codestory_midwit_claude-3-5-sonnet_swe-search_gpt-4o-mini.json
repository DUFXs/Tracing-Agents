    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is a patch that modifies the Django framework's 'expressions.py' file by adding a MOD operator for mixed numeric types, and it includes additional code for testing operations with decimal and integer values in a new file 'reproduce_error.py'. The code tests various operations including MOD and addition to verify functionality between different numeric types. In contrast, code sample 2 is a small patch that only shows part of the same file 'expressions.py', listing the operators including the MOD operator without any additional functionality or context. It provides no context or additional operations like those in sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 2 does not perform any operations or contain the same functionality present in code sample 1; it is merely part of a file which shows the use of the MOD operator.\"}"

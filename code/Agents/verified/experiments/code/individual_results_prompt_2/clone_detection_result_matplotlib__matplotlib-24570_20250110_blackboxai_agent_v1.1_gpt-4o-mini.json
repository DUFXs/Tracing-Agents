    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 consists of a Git patch indicating changes in a file within a Python library, specifically in 'lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py'. It shows a series of lines that configure how offsets for drawing elements are calculated based on the alignment specified. The lines calculate the 'descent' based on provided height data and modify 'offsets' based on alignment values like 'left', 'right', 'bottom', 'top', and 'center'. The actual code logic is intact and clustered around adjusting graphical elements. Meanwhile, code sample 2 contains essentially the same patch for the 'lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py' file, presenting an identical segment of the same logic, with no alterations in the code structure or computation. It strictly holds the same lines of code without any extraneous content, making it a straightforward representation of the patch without the additional context found in code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for the differing presentation in the patch format, and the actual lines of code are unchanged with respect to whitespace and layout.\"}"

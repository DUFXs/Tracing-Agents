    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 consists of multiple test cases that demonstrate vector addition involving zeros using the Sympy library for symbolic mathematics in Python. It initializes a reference frame, performs vector addition with zero vectors in different scenarios, and prints out the results. The tests include adding zero to a vector, adding a vector to zero, summing multiple vectors with zeros, and adding two zero vectors. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2, which is a segment from the Sympy library, defines the __add__ method for a Vector class, implementing how vectors should be added, including a check for when the other operand is zero. It\u2019s concerned with defining the behavior of vector addition rather than performing specific examples of it.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 contains specific test cases demonstrating vector operations and their outcomes, whereas code sample 2 implements a fundamental method for vector addition within a class. The objectives and contexts of the two samples are entirely different.\"}"

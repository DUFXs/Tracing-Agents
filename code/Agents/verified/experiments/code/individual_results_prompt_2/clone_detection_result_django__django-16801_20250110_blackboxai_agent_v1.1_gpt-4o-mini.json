    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 involves a conditional statement that connects a signal to a method called `update_dimension_fields` if certain conditions related to model properties are met. This is part of a larger context likely dealing with model initialization in Django's ORM. The method definition is provided for `update_dimension_fields`. Meanwhile, the code in code sample 2 contains similar signal connection logic but also includes additional commentary about forcing dimension updates, hinting at a broader functionality with potential checks on the instance's state when updating dimensions. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because although they share core logic and structure, code sample 2 has additional statements and comments that modify the context and functionality under discussion.\"}"

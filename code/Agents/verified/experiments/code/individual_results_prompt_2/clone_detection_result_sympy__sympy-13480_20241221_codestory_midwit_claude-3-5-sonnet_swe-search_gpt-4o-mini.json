It handles exceptions by printing errors if they occur during substitution. Code sample 2, on the other hand, contains a snippet from a function that deals with expressions related to hyperbolic functions, specifically the behavior of coth under certain conditions with respect to complex infinity. The first sample is a testing function, while the second sample is involved in the implementation of a mathematical function.

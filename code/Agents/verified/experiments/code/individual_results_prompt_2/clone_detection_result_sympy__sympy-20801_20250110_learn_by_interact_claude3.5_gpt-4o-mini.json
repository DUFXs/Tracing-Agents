    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains test cases that involve evaluating expressions using the `S` function from the SymPy library, specifically checking equality between certain SymPy objects and printing the results. The comments indicate there is a specific expected behavior that is not currently being met in these test cases. On the other hand, code sample 2 is an excerpt from a method in the `numbers.py` file that handles arithmetic operations with `Boolean` and checks if the object is a `NumberSymbol`, possibly returning comparison results for these objects. There are no test cases present, and it appears to add functionality related to not-equal comparison (e.g., using the `__ne__` method). Therefore, the two code samples address different functionalities and concepts within the same library and are not structurally or functionally similar.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve entirely different purposes \u2014 one is a test case while the other is part of an implementation dealing with Boolean comparisons.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"Code sample 1 demonstrates a testing script that uses the sympy library to create symbolic variables and print their types under various conditions, as well as running tests with both extra parentheses and comma-separated strings. It contains multiple print statements to show the expected versus actual types of the created symbols. Code sample 2 appears to display a segment of code from the sympy library that deals with processing names and collecting results into a tuple, as well as handling symbolic functions. It is a part of a function that converts names into symbols and manages various arguments. The two samples serve different purposes and are not directly related, with one being a test and the other a library implementation.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different functions; code sample 1 is a standalone test script using sympy, while code sample 2 is part of the sympy library's implementation dealing with symbolic variable creation.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 provides details regarding the file upload permissions in a Django application, including comments that explain the purpose of these settings. The sample specifies a default permission of 0o644 for uploaded files. Meanwhile, code sample 2 also outlines the same configurations about file upload permissions in a Django context, presenting the same permissions and comments, but does not include the information included before the 'FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' assignment that is present in code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace and layout, as both contain the same variable assignments and comments on the same topic.\"}"

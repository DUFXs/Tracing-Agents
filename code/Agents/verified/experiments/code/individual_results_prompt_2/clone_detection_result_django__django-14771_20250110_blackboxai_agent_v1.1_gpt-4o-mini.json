    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 initializes a variable 'py_script' with the path of the current script and then creates an 'args' list that includes the Python executable and warning options. It also has an extension of arguments based on additional options specified in 'sys._xoptions'. The comments indicate that there are conditions related to the '__spec__'. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 has similar initialization for 'py_script' and creates 'args' in a similar manner, but it checks if 'sys.implementation.name' is 'cpython' before extending 'args'. Additionally, it uses f-strings for formatting the options instead of a regular string formatting method as in code sample 1. Both codes include the same comments., \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have differences: code sample 2 adds a check for the implementation type ('cpython') and modifies the way strings are formatted with f-strings.\"}"

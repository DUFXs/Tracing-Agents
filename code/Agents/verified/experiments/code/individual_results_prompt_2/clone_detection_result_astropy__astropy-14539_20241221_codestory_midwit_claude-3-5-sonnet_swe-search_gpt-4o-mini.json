    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains a segment from 'astropy/io/fits/diff.py' which handles the comparison of two arrays (arra and arrb) possibly with variable-length elements. It checks if the data types are compatible and then determines if they are nearly equal using a defined tolerance (rtol and atol). The code also includes an if-else structure to manage different formats, particularly those that can handle variable-length arrays. However, the segment is incomplete. In contrast, code sample 2 contains an incomplete portion of the same file, capturing only part of the same if-else structure logic, specifically checking for the data type and beginning to compare the arrays. The crucial code logic regarding the creation of the 'diffs' variable is also present but is truncated early.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but differ in being complete and running. Code sample 1 has a complete structure and additional lines of handling that are absent in sample 2.\"}"

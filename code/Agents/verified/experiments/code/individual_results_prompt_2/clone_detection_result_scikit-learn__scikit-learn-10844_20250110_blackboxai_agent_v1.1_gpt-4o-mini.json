    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 initializes and performs a calculation based on a contingency matrix derived from two label sets, `labels_true` and `labels_pred`. It calculates `tk`, `pk`, and `qk`, which relate to pair counts in clustering, and then computes a similarity score through the square root of ratios, returning 0 in certain edge cases. Code sample 2 contains a similar structure but starts by checking the clusterings using the function `check_clusterings` and computes the same `tk`, `pk`, and `qk` values, followed by the similarity score. The main difference is the addition of `check_clusterings` and a variation in the zero-checking condition for `tk` in the return statement. Thus, it is evident that the two samples are nearly identical with slight variations, suggesting a modification rather than a complete re-write. Therefore, it outcomes as a type-3 clone because of added statements.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they have similar structure but contain added statements in code sample 2 and modifications in the return statement that check the value of `tk` differently.\"}"

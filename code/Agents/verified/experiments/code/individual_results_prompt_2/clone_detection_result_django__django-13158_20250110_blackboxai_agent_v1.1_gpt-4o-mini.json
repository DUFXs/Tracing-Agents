    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method called 'none' that returns an empty QuerySet in Django, handling combined queries by checking if 'combined_queries' exists and creating a new empty query appropriately. The handling of combined queries and setting the new query as empty is central to this method. In contrast, code sample 2 includes parts that deal with annotations and their masks, along with methods 'set_empty' and 'is_empty' that modify the query state and check if a query is empty by inspecting its conditions. The focus here is on managing annotations and their related query states, not on providing an empty QuerySet directly.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they address different functionalities related to Django's query management and have different method implementations with no syntactical or functional similarity.\"}"

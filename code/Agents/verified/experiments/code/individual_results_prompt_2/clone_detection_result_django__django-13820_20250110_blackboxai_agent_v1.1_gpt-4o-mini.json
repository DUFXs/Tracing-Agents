    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks if a module is a namespace package by verifying if it has a `__file__` attribute and if its `__path__` is a list. If it doesn't have a `__file__` and the `__path__` is not a list, it adds the application's configuration label to a set of unmigrated apps and continues processing. The code sample 1 also includes comments explaining the necessity of using `getattr()` on older Python versions. Whereas the code in code sample 2 overlaps with code sample 1 in functionality but contains different checks and structure. It raises an exception if it encounters a condition, and it also has additional comments, including references to namespace packages. However, it fundamentally operates similarly by assessing whether a module is a package or not, and it adds to the unmigrated apps set. The comments, layout, and slight variances in logic demonstrate that while they are related, they aren't identical or just variations of the same code.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they have different logic flow, different handling of checks, and additional conditions present in code sample 2 that do not exist in code sample 1.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 handles the case where a value is a sub-iterable and prepares to resolve sub-values for each item in that iterable. It appends resolved values into a list and ultimately returns a new instance of the type of the original value constructed from the resolved values. Meanwhile, code sample 2 also performs a similar operation by checking if the value is of list or tuple type, indicates that items within the iterable may need separate resolution, and returns a new instance of the type of the original value constructed from the resolved sub-values, but it has a slightly different structure in presentation. The essential logic is similar.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they exhibit syntactical similarity but vary in statement structure, indicating added or modified syntax without changing the overall functionality.\"}"

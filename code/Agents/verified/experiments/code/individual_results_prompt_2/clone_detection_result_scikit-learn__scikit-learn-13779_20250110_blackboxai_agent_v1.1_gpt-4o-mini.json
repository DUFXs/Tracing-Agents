It makes sure that if an estimator 'step' is not None and has no 'sample_weight' parameter, a ValueError is raised. The code sample 2 also checks if 'sample_weight' is not None and iterates over 'self.estimators', but it has a condition that continues if 'step' is None, rather than checking for it not None. Additionally, it has a modified condition that raises an error only if the check for 'step' returning None is passed, showing a different logical flow.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but have modified statements in their logic that change how they handle the conditions around 'step'.\"}"

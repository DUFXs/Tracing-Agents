If it was, it assigns the parameter and its value. It then checks if the extracted parameter is not in the defined parameters or keyword-only arguments and if varkw is None, indicating an unexpected keyword argument. An error is raised in this case. Meanwhile, code sample 2 performs the same function but lacks the initial lines that extract and define the unhandled_params list and the unhandled_kwargs list. The essence of the second code is similar to the relevant part of the first, focusing only on the check for unexpected keyword arguments and raising an error.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but the first sample has additional lines that extract unhandled parameters and keyword arguments that are not present in the second sample.\"}"

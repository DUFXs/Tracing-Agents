    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 updates a file patch by showing changes made to two files: the .gitignore file with entries for tests and build directories, and a block of code in the init.py file, which assigns a model to a content type and attempts to save it in a database transaction. In contrast, code sample 2 only shows the portion of the patch relevant to changes in the init.py file without including the .gitignore changes. The two samples both reflect the same logic for saving a content type with a fall-back mechanism for handling IntegrityErrors.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in content except for the differences in whitespace, layout, and the absence of the .gitignore changes in the second sample.\"}"

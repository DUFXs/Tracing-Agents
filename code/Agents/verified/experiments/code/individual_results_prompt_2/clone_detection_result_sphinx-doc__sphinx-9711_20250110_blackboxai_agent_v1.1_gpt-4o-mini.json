    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 checks the version of a specified extension and raises a VersionRequirementError if the current version is not at least the required version. If the extension version is 'unknown version', it raises the error immediately. It uses 'version.parse' to compare versions. In code sample 2, the logic is similar; however, it introduces a variable 'fulfilled' to track whether the requirements are met and includes exception handling for invalid versions. Both samples utilize the same error raising mechanism and version comparison logic, but sample 2 is more extensive with additional handling for invalid versions.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they contain similar logic and functionality but differ in terms of added or modified variable handling (i.e., the 'fulfilled' variable in sample 2) and the presence of exception handling.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 creates an initial model called 'test_model' with specified fields and options using the CreateModel class. It then tries to alter the options of this model by creating an AlterModelOptions operation with an empty dictionary of options. Finally, it attempts to merge these operations and checks if the new options of the create operation are empty as expected. The code reflects a process of creating and modifying a model in Django migrations. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 is incomplete but appears to be part of the same functionality where it handles the AlterModelOptions and merging of options involving fields and managing the return of a CreateModel operation. However, it focuses on merging options rather than creating and verifying them. The two snippets deal with similar operations on models in Django but differ in their depth and implementation details.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different processes in handling model options and alterations, particularly in how options are created and merged. They are not identical or variations of one another.\"}"

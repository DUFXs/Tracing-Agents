In code sample 2, the code also sorts imports similarly but has modifications in the comments, the key function, and appears to employ a lambda function instead of a named function for sorting. Both samples ultimately perform the same operation, which is sorting a list of imports and generating a string representation of those imports.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but with added, modified, or removed statements, particularly the change from a named function to a lambda function.\"}"

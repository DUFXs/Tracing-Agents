    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is responsible for managing related field values in a Django model. It checks if a related object is saved, sets initial values, and uses a post-save hook to update foreign keys if necessary. It also handles caching of values. On the other hand, the code in code sample 2 deals with setting the primary key (pk) of a related object in a Django model when it has been saved. It contains a conditional check for empty values and sets the attribute if conditions are met.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes within the Django framework. Code sample 1 focuses on initializing and updating related field values, while code sample 2 focuses on assigning primary keys from related objects based on their saved status. Therefore, they are syntactically dissimilar and functionally distinct.\"}"

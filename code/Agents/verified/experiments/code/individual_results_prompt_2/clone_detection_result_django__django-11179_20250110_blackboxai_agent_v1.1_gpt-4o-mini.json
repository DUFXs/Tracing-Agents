However, code sample 1 includes additional information in the patch related to a .gitignore file that is not present in code sample 2, but this part does not affect the functional part of the code provided since we are comparing the Python code sections. The Python code itself is identical in both samples.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical apart from the insignificant differences in whitespace and additional context in code sample 1.\"}"

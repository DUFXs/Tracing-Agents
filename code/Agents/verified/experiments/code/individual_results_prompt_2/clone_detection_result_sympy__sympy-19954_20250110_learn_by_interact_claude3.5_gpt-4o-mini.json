    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a DihedralGroup with 18 elements and retrieves its Sylow 2-subgroup, printing the results. It does a similar operation with a DihedralGroup of 50 elements. In code sample 2, the focus is on checking and ensuring the minimality of representative blocks in a set, utilizing a boolean mask to filter out non-minimal blocks. While both samples deal with combinatorial systems, their purposes are distinctly different. Code sample 1 involves setting up groups and displaying their Sylow subgroups, while code sample 2 involves maintaining a minimal state of representative blocks in a set.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they address different functionalities within the combinatorial framework, with code sample 1 focusing on group theory operations and code sample 2 on managing non-minimal blocks.\"}"

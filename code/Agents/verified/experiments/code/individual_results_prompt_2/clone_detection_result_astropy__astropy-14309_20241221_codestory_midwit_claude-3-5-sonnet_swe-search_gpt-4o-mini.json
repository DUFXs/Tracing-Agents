    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 includes a function that determines if the provided file has a FITS extension based on the file name, checks conditions on inputs, and potentially returns a boolean. It also imports various functions and classes from the astropy library used for handling FITS files. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 checks if a file related to FITS is correctly identified by seeking to a position and returning a boolean indicating whether the file path ends with a certain FITS extension. Both snippets are concerned with checking file types related to FITS extensions and HDF5 but are implemented differently.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they have different implementations and serve slightly different functions, even though they share the common goal of checking FITS file validity.\"}"

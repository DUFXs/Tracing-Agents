    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a way to convert a string containing a mathematical expression into a symbolic expression using the function `kernS` from the SymPy library. It imports necessary components and initializes various variables. The second code sample is a snippet from the same `sympy/core/sympify.py` file that focuses on modifying how string replacements are handled concerning a variable called `kern`. While both codes deal with similar concepts regarding string manipulation, only code sample 1 has a broader context involving imports and initialization related to a mathematical expression, while sample 2 appears to be part of an error handling or string modification routine. Since both code samples are drawn from the same file but perform different functions, they do not represent clones.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes within the code, with one focused on expression handling and the other on string modification logic.\"}"

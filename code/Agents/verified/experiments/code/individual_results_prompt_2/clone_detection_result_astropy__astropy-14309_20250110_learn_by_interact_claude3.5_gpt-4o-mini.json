    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a patch that includes functionality to register FITS file readers, writers, and identifiers in the `astropy` library. It checks whether a given file adheres to certain extensions associated with FITS files and whether the argument is an instance of specific HDU classes. In contrast, code sample 2 appears to be a continuation of a function that checks if a given file path corresponds to a valid FITS file extension and validates if the first argument is of a certain type. However, code sample 2 has fewer lines and lacks the context of registering formats. Both snippets involve the handling of FITS files, but code sample 2 is not directly functionally equivalent to code sample 1 and has different statements.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 contains additional logic for registration and checks with multiple return statements, while code sample 2 focuses solely on returning boolean checks for file types and signatures. The syntactic structure and purpose differ significantly.\"}"

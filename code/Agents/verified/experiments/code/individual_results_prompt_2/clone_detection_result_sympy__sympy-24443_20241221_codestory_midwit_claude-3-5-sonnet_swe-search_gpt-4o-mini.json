    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 creates a Dihedral group of order 3 (D3) and attempts to create a homomorphism from D3 to itself using its generators, ultimately printing a success message. The code uses functions from the `sympy.combinatorics` library, particularly dealing with group theory concepts. The code in code sample 2 appears to define functions related to checking homomorphisms and mapping generators to images, elaborating on conditions and parameters for verifying a homomorphism in group theory. It is more focused on internal checks and representation than creating or using specific group instances.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes; the first is focused on group creation and homomorphism instantiation while the second deals with the validation of homomorphism conditions.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 implements part of a method that checks if two objects are equal, specifically comparing a number with a boolean value in the sympy library. It raises a SympifyError if the conversion fails and checks if the other object is a Boolean or a NumberSymbol. If it is a NumberSymbol, it retrieves its mpf value and compares it to the current object's mpf value for equality. The '__ne__' method is likely part of a class that defines not-equal behavior. Conversely, code sample 2 has similar logic for checking equality but includes an extra line that appears to handle the case when the instance itself evaluates to False. Overall, both samples share much of the same structure and logic but differ in a comment and the additional conditional check in sample 2. Additionally, code sample 1 provides part of a testing function that checks consistency between S(0.0) and S.false, while sample 2 does not have this testing code.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar but contain added or modified statements, specifically the additional check in code sample 2 that is not present in code sample 1.\"}"

If it is, it iterates over the 'estimators' and raises a ValueError if any estimator does not support sample weights. It includes a call to check if the estimators have been fitted and then calls the '_predict' method. In code sample 2, there is a similar check for 'sample_weight', iterating over 'estimators'; however, it includes a condition that skips None estimators before checking for sample weight support. The handling of the None case is a significant logical difference between the two samples.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar, albeit with the addition of a None check in code sample 2 which alters how the loop is handled.\"}"

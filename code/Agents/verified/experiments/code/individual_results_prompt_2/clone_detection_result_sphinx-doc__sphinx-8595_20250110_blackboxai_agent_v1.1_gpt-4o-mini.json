    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method 'get_object_members' that retrieves members of a module based on a boolean flag 'want_all'. If 'want_all' is true and '__all__' is not defined, it documents all members. Otherwise, it checks the defined '__all__' and only documents those members. The second code sample also defines the same method 'get_object_members' with similar logic, but includes additional comments about implicit module members and the documentation process. The overall structure and logic are very similar, though code sample 2 has fewer statements and provides comments on implicit module members.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they exhibit syntactical similarity but with some added comments and fewer statements in code sample 2, making them functionally equivalent.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines output handling for a transformer feature in a machine learning estimator, specifically using a safety method to set the output for transformers and handle any remainder that does not pass through or is dropped. It also checks if there's a fitted remainder and applies the output function to it. The second code sample comprises a similar structure, focusing on setting output for transformers with a comment suggesting it is part of a larger class or function concerning transformers. It also handles the remainder but possesses some differences in the comments and syntax, suggesting a more structural combination. The resemblance indicates both samples are implicitly doing the same operations with transformations and output handling.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones as they are syntactically similar but have structural differences and may contain additional or slightly modified statements.\"}"

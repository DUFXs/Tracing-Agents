    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 includes some details about a git patch alongside a portion of code related to time representation in the Django framework, specifically showing how to handle attributes of a datetime object. The code in code sample 2 contains only the actual code portion that handles the same attributes of the datetime object, without any git patch information. Both snippets include identical lines of code that process hours, minutes, and seconds from a datetime object. Hence, they can be considered as exploring the same functionality of retrieving time attributes from datetime within the Django framework.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in functionality and code structure, differing only due to the presence of additional git patch metadata in code sample 1.\"}"

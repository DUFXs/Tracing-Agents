    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 prepares a list of feature names where it checks if the provided feature_names are defined. If they are defined, it assigns values from feature_names; if not, it assigns a default value of 'undefined'. It constructs this list using a list comprehension. Additionally, it initializes an empty report and calls a function to print the tree recursively before returning the report. The code in code sample 2 also prepares a list of feature names in a similar way but uses 'None' instead of 'undefined' for undefined features. It constructs the list of feature names without a conditional for TREE_UNDEFINED in the else block. The initial value_fmt and function calls remain the same, but the conditional logic for undefined values differs.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar, but there are differences in the handling of undefined feature names, leading to the inclusion of 'None' in the second sample instead of 'undefined'.\"}"

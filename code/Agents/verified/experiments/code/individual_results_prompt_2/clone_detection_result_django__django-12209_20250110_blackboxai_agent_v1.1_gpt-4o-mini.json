    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 appears to handle database updates within a Django model, dealing with conditions related to primary keys and update fields. It raises exceptions when conditions are not met, indicating errors during forced updates or inserts. It also includes checks for the existence of a primary key. In contrast, code sample 2 seems to focus on handling a situation where an instance is being added and has a default for the primary key, skipping the update under certain conditions. This sample introduces different logic related to instance addition and defaults, suggesting different functionalities.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they implement different functionalities and logic related to database updates and instance additions, thus falling into different syntactical and functional domains.\"}"

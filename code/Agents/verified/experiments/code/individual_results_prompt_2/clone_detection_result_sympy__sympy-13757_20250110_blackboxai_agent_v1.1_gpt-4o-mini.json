    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines variables related to polynomial handling in a symbolic mathematics library, including boolean flags for commutativity and a priority value for operations. It also includes method definitions for creating a new polynomial instance and handling the multiplication of polynomials. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 contains similar definitions but with a different priority value. However, it is significantly shorter and lacks various pieces of functionality found in the first sample. The core logic is lessened, with only the commutative and Poly flags and the method to create a new polynomial. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-2\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are identical in structure but differ in the literal value of the '_op_priority' variable and their length, while the rest of the content is similar.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is part of a Django formset implementation. It includes a definition for a BooleanField labeled 'Delete' that is used when a form is being processed, indicating whether an item can be deleted. This part checks whether the form can be deleted based on the conditions like whether there are extra deletions allowed or if the index is within the initial form count. Code sample 2, on the other hand, is a snippet where the same BooleanField is also being defined but the layout and certain whitespace aspects differ, particularly in the formatting of the conditional statement that starts with 'if self.can_delete and ('. The logic remains the same, but the positioning and spacing have changed significantly, notably in the condition that checks if it can delete. Both samples define the same structure and behavior, but sample 2 shows a more compact layout. However, the logic they implement is identical.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical in logic and functionality, differing only in whitespace and layout formatting.\"}"

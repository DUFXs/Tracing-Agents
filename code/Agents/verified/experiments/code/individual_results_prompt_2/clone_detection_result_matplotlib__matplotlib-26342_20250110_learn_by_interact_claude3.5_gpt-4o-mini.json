    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines properties for 'alpha' and 'linestyles', and specifies a method 'set_paths' which marks a ContourSet as needing a redraw after setting its paths. It also demonstrates creating contour plots using matplotlib with sample data and then attempts to set new transformed paths. The code sample 2, on the other hand, appears to be part of a class that manages paths, providing methods to set and get paths and presumably manage some states of visual objects like contours. It returns the paths held in the collection and also contains a method to update states when sizes change. Thus, while they both deal with contour plotting, code sample 1 is more focused on creating and modifying contour sets, while code sample 2 is part of a direction that manages the paths of those contours.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they focus on different aspects of functionality: one is for contour creation and manipulation, while the other is for managing paths.\"}"

It also calls the method save_m2m() after saving the user. The code in code sample 2 performs similar actions but includes a conditional check using hasattr to ensure that save_m2m() is called only if the method exists before calling it. This adds a layer of safety for potential variations in the context where the code is executed.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar with the addition of a conditional check in code sample 2 for calling save_m2m(). This means there is a modification in the logic that reflects a difference in implementation rather than just a textual or structural difference.\"}"

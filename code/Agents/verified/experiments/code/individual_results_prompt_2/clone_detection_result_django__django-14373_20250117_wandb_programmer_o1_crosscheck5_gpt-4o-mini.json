    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines functions for formatting dates in the Django framework, specifically methods to return the year as a four-digit string and the day of the year. The formatting for the year function uses '%04d', which ensures four digits are displayed (including leading zeros if necessary). The second file tests the formatting of the year by checking a date object with a specific year and comparing the returned formatted string with an expected string. The code in code sample 2 contains a similar method for formatting the year and defining the day of the year; however, it includes an additional return statement that formats the year differently (using '%02d' for the last two digits of the year) and has slightly altered comments. It also lacks the test structure present in the first sample.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar with added, modified, or removed statements. Both samples share the same method signatures and functionality, but sample 2 includes an additional line of code that returns the last two digits of the year, while sample 1 does not. Additionally, there are differences in the comments and some formatting, but the core logic remains quite similar.\"}"

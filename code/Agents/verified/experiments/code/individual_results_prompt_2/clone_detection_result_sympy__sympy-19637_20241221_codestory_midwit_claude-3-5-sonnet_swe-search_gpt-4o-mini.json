    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 appears to define a testing framework for the 'kernS' function from the 'sympy.core.sympify' module, where it applies this function to various expressions and prints the results. Specifically, it tests expressions with spaces, negation, and nested parentheses, showcasing the results of processing these expressions. The code in code sample 2, on the other hand, is a fragment from the 'sympy/core/sympify.py' file that is part of the implementation of the 'kernS' function itself. It includes logic related to handling kerning in strings, replacing spaces with a unique 'kern', and checking if 'kern' is found in the string; however, it lacks context specifying its role in the 'kernS' test cases found in sample 1. Thus, while both code samples are related to the same functionality, they serve different purposes with distinct syntactical structures. In this case, they are not clones because they are not syntactically similar in structure and intent.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because the first sample consists of test cases for a function while the second sample contains a core part of the function's implementation, leading to significant differences in their syntax and logic.\"}"

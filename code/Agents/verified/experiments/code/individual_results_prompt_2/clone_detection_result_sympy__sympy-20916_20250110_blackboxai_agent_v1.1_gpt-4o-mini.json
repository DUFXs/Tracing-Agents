    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a regular expression '_name_with_digits_p' to match names that may end with digits and a function 'split_super_sub(text)' which likely processes text for some purpose. It seems that the code snippet provided is incomplete as it doesn't show any functionality for the 'split_super_sub' function. The code in code sample 2 includes similar import statements and the declaration of '_name_with_digits_p', but it contains additional logic and a raised RuntimeError indicating that there's more to the function 'split_super_sub' or additional functionalities related to it. Specifically, code sample 2 includes comments and logic for handling cases where a name matches the regex. Therefore, the two samples are not identical and also have different structures. Therefore, they are not clones.\",\"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 lacks additional statements and error handling present in code sample 2, indicating that they have diverged in functionality.\"}"

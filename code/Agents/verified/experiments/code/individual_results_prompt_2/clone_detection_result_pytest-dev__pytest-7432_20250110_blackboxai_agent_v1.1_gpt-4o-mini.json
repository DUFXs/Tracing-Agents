    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is a patch that includes code for handling test reporting in pytest, specifically related to the outcome of tests that may be skipped or marked as expected to fail. It ensures that information about the skipped tests is correctly reported, adjusting the location of error messages to point to the test definition instead of where the exception occurred. Code sample 2 includes a portion of the same functionality, specifically the handling of outcomes when tests are skipped, checking if the test was marked with skip conditions and responding accordingly. It is a continuation of or a fragment from code sample 1, focusing on the same context of test outcome reporting. Therefore, they share a similar purpose and structure, but sample 2 reflects only a part of the implementation shown in sample 1. However, the snippets exhibit differences in layout and whitespace, with additional statements present in the first sample.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar and sample 2 is a part of the functionality shown in sample 1, thereby sharing operational logic but also having additional context in sample 1.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a constructor method that initializes 'models' and 'real_apps' parameters for a class, ensuring 'real_apps' is a set. It also checks if 'real_apps' is valid and then assigns it to 'self.real_apps'. The second code sample shows a modified version of a similar constructor where 'real_apps' is initialized to a set if it's None, and it asserts that 'real_apps' is indeed a set afterward. The first sample has additional comments and detail for raising errors, while the second is more concise. \", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they share a similar structure and functionality but have differences such as condition handling and the presence of an assertion, indicating modifications in the logic between the two versions.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a method for creating a new permutation object with various checks for validation, including ensuring that a list of integer inputs does not have duplicates and meets specific conditions for being a cycle. It handles multiple formats of input for permutations and raises exceptions if the input is invalid. The code in code sample 2 appears to be a fragment that focuses on checking if the input arguments have duplicates after flattening the input list and raising a ValueError if they do, specifically tied to cycles. It is a continuation of the logic found in code sample 1, completing a part of the validation process for permutations.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because code sample 2 is syntactically similar to part of the logic in code sample 1, containing validation checks related to duplicates in permutation inputs. However, it is not identical as it represents a segment of larger logic.\"}"

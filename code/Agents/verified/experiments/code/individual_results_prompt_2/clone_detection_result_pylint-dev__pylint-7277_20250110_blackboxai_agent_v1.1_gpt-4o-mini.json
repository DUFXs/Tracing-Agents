    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is processing the 'sys.path' to remove specific entries based on certain conditions, like checking if the first entry is empty or the current working directory. It also checks the 'PYTHONPATH' environment variable and pops elements from 'sys.path' if they meet certain criteria. Code sample 2 does similar operations but contains a different order of statements and lacks the comment lines and other pieces from code sample 1. Both samples work towards cleaning up the 'sys.path' based on the environment variable. However, they differ in literals and whitespace.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-2\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace, layout, and comments, as well as differences in the order of statements.\"}"

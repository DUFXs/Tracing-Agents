The operations include standard multiplication as well as multiplication with SymPy's symbolic numeric support.

It is part of the Poly class and defines its constructor. \", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes within the SymPy library: one is focused on testing polynomial multiplication, while the other defines attributes and a constructor for a polynomial class.\"}"

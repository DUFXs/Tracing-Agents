    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 is primarily dealing with setting the `Content-Type` header for different file types being processed. It defines a mapping of various compression types to their corresponding MIME types and retrieves the appropriate `content_type` based on the `encoding`. Then, it sets this `content_type` in the response headers and prepares the data for initialization with a JSON format. Code sample 2, however, only contains the part of that mapping process where it creates the `content_type` dictionary for handling compressed file types. It includes comments about the encoding being set to prevent automatic uncompression but does not involve setting headers or processing response data.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-2\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-2 clones because they are identical in terms of structure and logic but differ in the addition of comments and the context in which they appear (with additional code in sample 1). The initial mapping of content types and retrieval based on encoding is present in both, and while there are slight differences in whitespace and comments, the essential structure remains consistent.\"}"

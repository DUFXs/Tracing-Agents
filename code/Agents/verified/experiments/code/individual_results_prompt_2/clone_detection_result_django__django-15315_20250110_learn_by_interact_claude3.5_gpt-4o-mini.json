    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function `test_hash_stability` that checks the stability of the hash value of a Django model field, specifically `CharField`, by creating instances of the model and asserting that the hash of the field remains consistent even when used as a key in a dictionary. It also contains a nested class `Book` that represents a Django model with a `title` field and another class `AnotherBook` using the same field. The code in code sample 2 is a patch excerpt from a Django model field file that shows the definitions of methods like `__hash__` and `__deepcopy__`, but does not contain the comprehensive logic or models found in code sample 1.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because code sample 1 contains a complete function and model definitions, while code sample 2 only includes method definitions, and there is no semantic or structural similarity to classify them as any type of clone.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 contains a Python script that imports the sympy library, defines a symbol 'x', and performs simplifications on trigonometric and complex expressions using the simplify function. Additionally, it includes test cases for the simplify function on various expressions with real and complex exponents. The code in code sample 2, also part of the sympy library, seems to handle simplification logic, specifically checking if a certain expression is a power and returning an expression based on certain conditions related to real exponents. However, it lacks the context of the surrounding code or test cases that code sample 1 has.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they serve different purposes within the sympy library, focus on different aspects of the simplification process, and do not share similar structure or content that fits the clone definitions provided.\"}"

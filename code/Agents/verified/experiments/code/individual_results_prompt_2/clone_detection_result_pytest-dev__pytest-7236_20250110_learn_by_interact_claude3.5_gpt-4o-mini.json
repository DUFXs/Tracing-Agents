    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 deals with pytest's handling of test case teardown procedures and whether to execute tearDown methods based on test skip criteria. It checks if the test method is marked as skipped and postpones the execution of tearDown if necessary. Code sample 2, on the other hand, involves a similar mechanism of handling skipped tests and introduces a fixture for pytest that will manage setup and teardown procedures. It also checks if the object is skipped but includes additional logic for handling skipped tests and setup injections.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they convey distinct functionalities related to handling skipped tests and teardown processes; they share some concepts but are implemented differently with different structures and logic.\"}"

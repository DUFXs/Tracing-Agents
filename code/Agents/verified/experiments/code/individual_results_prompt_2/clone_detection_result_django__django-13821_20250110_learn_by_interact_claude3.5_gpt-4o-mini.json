    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 defines a function `check_sqlite_version` that checks the version of SQLite being used. If the version is lower than 3.9.0, it raises an `ImproperlyConfigured` exception with an error message. It then calls this function. Additionally, it defines another function `_sqlite_rpad` that returns a padded string to a specified length by repeating `fill_text`. The code in sample 2 also defines the same `check_sqlite_version` function and its functionality is identical; however, it does not include the `_sqlite_rpad` function. The primary focus of the second sample is the version check and exception raising. Both samples include the same logic and error message, but sample 2 has different formatting and indentation, leading to differences in whitespace and layout.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-1\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-1 clones because they are identical except for differences in whitespace, layout, and comments.\"}"

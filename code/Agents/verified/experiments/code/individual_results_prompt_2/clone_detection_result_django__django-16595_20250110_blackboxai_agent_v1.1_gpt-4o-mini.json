The `reduce` method determines whether to keep one of the operations based on their similarity. The code in code sample 2 also defines the `reduce` method but appears to handle both AlterField and RemoveField operations, allowing it to return a modified or simplified set of operations depending on the situation as well. Both snippets involve similar conditional checks for operation type and logic for reducing migration operations.\", \"is_clone\": true, \"classification\": \"type-3\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are type-3 clones because they are syntactically similar, with added or removed statements as well as minor differences in logic and identifiers.\"}"

    "response": "{\"explanation\": \"The code in code sample 1 manages the evaluation of `xfailed` markers after the execution of tests, which includes storing the evaluated markers and checking conditions to determine if a test should be marked as expected to fail. It also handles a special case for unexpected successes in test executions. In contrast, the code in code sample 2 seems to implement hooks in pytest for handling skipped tests and expectations of failure within the test lifecycle, leveraging decorators to set up these hooks. It evaluates conditions similar to the first sample, but focuses on dynamic marking and storing of `skipped` tests as well as handling when tests should be treated as xfailed. Therefore, while there are similarities in functionality related to xfail handling, the structure and specific logic differ significantly.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they have different implementations and functionalities despite some overlapping concepts related to handling expected failures in tests.\"}"

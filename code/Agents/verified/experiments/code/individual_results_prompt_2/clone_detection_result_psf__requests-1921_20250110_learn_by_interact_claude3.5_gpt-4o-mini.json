The code in code sample 2 continues from the previous logic by refining the merged settings to include only those key-value pairs where the value is not None and then returns the updated dictionary.\", \"is_clone\": false, \"classification\": \"N/A\", \"reasoning\": \"These code samples are not clones because they perform different operations on the merged settings. Code sample 1 focuses on updating the settings and defining a function, while code sample 2 specifically filters out None values from the merged settings.\"}"
